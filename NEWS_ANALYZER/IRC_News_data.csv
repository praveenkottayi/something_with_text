1,How Big Data Models Can Create More Data Insights In Future,"Big Data has evolved over the years and transformed various forms of data; right from the industrial data to customer-centric behavioral data.

1,Big data and the future of healthcare industry,"Advances in data analytics enhance accessibility, affordability and quality of health services, writes KAMAL BRAR

ONE of the greatest challenges facing governments around the world is how to provide their citizens with effective and affordable healthcare. This is in fact a highly complex set of problems with multiple causes and a variety of actions needed in response. Happily, advances in technology are holding out the promise of addressing the challenge.

As in developed countries around the world, Malaysia's healthcare providers must deal with a rapidly ageing population, leading to an influx of patients, and increasing pressure on general practitioners and hospital emergency departments. People are living longer - which actually reflects one of Malaysia's success stories - healthcare. In the 60 years since independence, we have increased our lifespan by about 20 years.

Improvements in primary public healthcare, such as sanitation, food safety and protection against infectious diseases via vaccination, have all contributed to this increased life expectancy. Unfortunately, however, living longer has not translated to better quality of life.

Of particular concern are the statistics on obesity and diabetes. The National Health and Morbidity Survey 2015 revealed that obese Malaysians make up 17.7 per cent of the population, compared with just 4.4 per cent in 1996.

The same survey found that 17.5 per cent of Malaysians aged 18 and above - around 3.5 million people - have diabetes. In 2006, this figure was 11.6 per cent.

One thing is clear from these numbers - more Malaysians are having to live longer in ill health.

Will the country be able to cope with the increasing number of the elderly and ill? The proposed Aged Healthcare Act is a start, though its primary aim is better regulation and monitoring of aged healthcare centres in the country.

The healthcare industry has always generated large amounts of data for purposes of patient care, compliance and record-keeping. The advent of the Internet of Things has caused an explosion in data, from sensors to health-tracking applications and devices that healthcare providers can tap into to optimise resources, bring greater efficiencies and develop an integrated healthcare system.

The capture and analysis of this mass of raw data has the potential to transform healthcare, to enhance the accessibility, affordability and quality of healthcare to meet the needs of Malaysians across different stages of their healthcare journey - from diagnosis and treatment, to post-discharge follow-up.

Big data in healthcare refers to electronic health data sets that are so large and complex that it would be difficult to manage and analyse using traditional software and data management tools and methods. With big data, healthcare organisations have the ability to let multiple hospitals exchange information, leading to a 360-view of their patients, so doctors can give a more complete diagnosis.

Healthcare services companies have gained significant value through the ability to take in data from a variety of sources, such as lab and patient data, to recognise patterns and supply this data to doctors to provide recommendations on how patients can improve their health. Without Big Data, none of this would be possible and healthcare organisations would be operating without having the complete picture.

When a person's medical records are shared among all public health institutions, the patient's journey is simplified from primary to tertiary care, in both the public and private sectors, as any doctor treating the patient would have full access to his or her medical records

There are many other ways in which technology is being adopted, putting health data to work in the pursuit of improved healthcare.

For example, hospitals have begun to use radio-frequency identification (RFID) to track equipment and medicines as they move throughout their facilities. RFID scans of an item or device can capture their contents, location, manufacture date, order numbers and shipping data. This information can ensure medicines are utilised before their expiry date or quickly locate an important piece of equipment.

In the longer term, historical data on the interactions of medicines, equipment and doctors will provide valuable information for healthcare predictive analytics, as well as helping to plan purchases, train staff and improve operational efficiency.

In another advance on traditional practice, wireless sensors are being used to capture and transmit patient vitals more frequently than staff can make bedside visits. These signals can provide real-time alerts, so caregivers can respond more promptly to unexpected changes. Accumulating this data over time enables healthcare predictive analytics to proactively help predict the likelihood of an emergency, even before it could be detected with a bedside visit.

One common problem with our existing healthcare system is re-admission rates. Patients with heart disease, for example, are closely monitored in the hospital, but may skip their medications or ignore dietary and self-care instructions when they go home.

Healthcare, especially on a national level, will continue to be a major challenge for authorities. Demographic and lifestyle changes in populations, as well as outbreaks of unanticipated diseases, will constantly demand innovative responses from governments and the healthcare profession.

Fortunately, advances in healthcare data analytics are keeping pace with the evolving nature of the challenge. Patients and healthcare staff alike can be confident that technology is on their side.

1,"Accenture Boosts Its Amazon Web Services Capabilities, Helping Clients Leverage the Cloud to Strengthen Business Intelligence and Spur Innovation","Accenture  is expanding its Amazon Web Services (AWS) capabilities to help enterprises better leverage the cloud to increase operational efficiency, strengthen their business intelligence, and develop innovative new products and services more quickly.

The expanded capabilities include three new groups of offerings: applied intelligence on AWS, data centricity and analytics on AWS, and cloud native development, all created in collaboration with AWS through the Accenture AWS Business Group (AABG). Accenture is also establishing innovation ‘pods’ – dedicated space within Accenture Liquid Studios and innovation center locations around the world where cloud specialists from Accenture and AWS plan to work together to build intelligent solutions on AWS; one such example is an AI-powered elder-care solution that Accenture has piloted recently.

In addition, Accenture has launched a dedicated AWS practice that is expected to provide full-stack delivery and software engineering on AWS. Focused on AWS services, this new practice includes more than 1,400 AWS-certified consultants dedicated to help deliver full-stack on AWS.

Together, these new capabilities strengthen the AABG, which Accenture formed in October 2015 in collaboration with AWS to help enterprises migrate, develop and manage their applications on AWS.

“One of our goals with the Accenture AWS Business Group is to bring the breadth of AWS services together and demonstrate what’s possible on the cloud,” said Chris Wegmann, managing director and global leader of Accenture’s AWS practice. “Our clients demand digital transformation supported by the cloud, and developing end-to-end solutions on AWS helps them to bring innovation and agility to the core of their digital transformation journeys.”

According to the results of a recent IDG study sponsored by Accenture and AWS and based on a survey of 600 cloud-using companies, organizations with more than half of their infrastructure and apps in the cloud report more quantifiable benefits than those with less than 30 percent on the cloud. Those with the highest level of cloud provision are also experiencing much deeper transformative value, including improved customer satisfaction.

In addition to operating on the cloud, Accenture clients are using AWS services, such as AWS Lambda and Amazon Connect, to achieve breakthrough results beyond infrastructure improvement benefits.

“As we leverage cloud architecture, we’re seeing the benefits come through already, including cost efficiency, resilience, and improved time to market,” said Sandra Stonham, managing director of technology and operations at DBS, an AABG client. “We are quite confident we will see increased value as we continue on our journey toward fully cloud-enabled technology.”

“We are thrilled to see Accenture’s focus on AI, data centricity and analytics, and native cloud development, along with the additional resources of the AWS practice,” said Mike Clayville, vice president of worldwide commercial sales and business development, Amazon Web Services, Inc. “These new capabilities further support our customers in transforming organizational processes and skills, adopting a cloud-first strategy to innovate new products and services, operating more securely at global scale, and quickly achieving business results.”

To help customers manage their growing AWS cloud estate, Accenture has introduced a new version of the Accenture Cloud Platform (ACP). ACP 4.0 now helps customers to manage legacy and cloud resources through an integrated control plane delivered as a service. The serverless platform, built on AWS Lambda and other AWS services, helps enterprises apply advanced analytics, automated policies, improved security features and cloud billing at scale.

The AABG helps clients capitalize on a cloud-first agenda by developing agile, enterprise cloud solutions to drive innovation and transform business processes, tooling, and talent to address the new opportunities inherent in the intelligent enterprise on AWS. The AABG has trained 3,200 Accenture technologists and earned more than 1,400 AWS certifications, helping enterprise clients – such as Avalon Healthcare Solutions, Capital One, Hess Corporation, and Mediaset – accelerate innovation for ongoing business transformation."

1,"Sunbird(R) dcTrack(R) DCIM Operations 6.0 Provides Data Center Business Intelligence and Change Management Enhancements



New What-If and DCOI Dashboards, Stranded Power Charts, and Request and Work Order Improvements Enable Data Center Managers to Optimize Capacity Management and Day-to-Day Operations","Sunbird Software, a global innovator in software solutions that simplify how data centers are managed, today announced the general availability of dcTrack(R) Data Center Infrastructure Management (DCIM) Operations Release 6.0. This newest release delivers data center business intelligence and visual analytics to facilitate data center optimization. Additionally, change management improvements help data center managers ensure that requests and work orders are completed accurately, on time, and in compliance with organizational or SLA requirements.

""Technology trends like big data, Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI) create opportunity for business innovation but place a significant resource burden on modern data centers,"" said Herman Chan, President of Sunbird Software. ""Today's data center managers need a fast, accurate, and easy way to predict and analyze power and space capacity for on-demand deployment of IT resources. The new dashboards and chart widgets in Release 6.0 provide this information at a glance with the ability to drill down to the raw data for more granular analysis. The request and work order improvements complement this data-driven approach by ensuring that the changes required to support customer demand are made in a timely manner and as specified.""

Dashboard Enhancements Drive Capacity and Energy Efficiency

Release 6.0 enhances dcTrack's data center business intelligence dashboards with more advanced visual analysis so users can better manage capacity. The new what-if dashboard and charts display power and space utilization on a per-project basis to help data center managers accurately estimate the net impact of future projects on capacity. Armed with this data, data center managers can determine if they can better utilize capacity to delay costly capital expenditures or if the projects will create a shortfall of resources. Having this information before the projects kick off better positions data center managers to meet customer demand without interruptions to service.

dcTrack 6.0 also introduces stranded power charts that further enable data center managers to maximize capacity utilization. Users can analyze actual, budgeted, and stranded power capacity by make, model, and other asset parameters so they can pinpoint where they have overprovisioned. These charts leverage specifications from Sunbird's Models Library of over 30,000 models across 450 vendors to ensure data integrity and accuracy.

The new Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI) executive dashboard has been developed to provide federal data center teams with one-click access to a single view of the key metrics used to measure compliance with this government mandate. However, any data center manager interested in boosting energy efficiency can benefit from tracking the metrics captured on the DCOI dashboard: energy metering, facility utilization, power usage effectiveness (PUE), server utilization and automated monitoring, and virtualization.

For any chart in dcTrack 6.0, users can drilldown to the raw data that drives the chart and can view, search, or export the data in tabular format for external use or analysis. Users can export the chart data to CSV or PDF formats, save the charts as image files to embed in presentations, or create a slideshow to easily share this information with their management teams.

""Today's data center managers are looking for DCIM tools that can tangibly improve data center efficiency and continuity,"" said Andrew Donoghue, European Research Manager, 451 Research. ""Sunbird's newest release has a number of features designed to meet these requirements. The system's intuitive dashboard should aid effective decision-making through improved analytics. There are also other practical features such as workflow management enhancements that can help streamline operational processes and reduce the risk of human error.""

Request and Work Order Improvements Enable More Effective Change Management

Release 6.0 enhances dcTrack's existing request and work order capabilities to accelerate data center changes. Request submissions and approvals are subject to role-based granular permissions to limit who can affect the request process and to ensure compliance with organizational requirements. Users can specify at the task template or individual task level how they want tasks to be performed and whom they want notified as each task is completed.

The history of each request is tracked within the software so users can measure workflow effectiveness, determine if target intervals are being achieved, and maintain a record of the work completed for future reference. Multiple requests can be aggregated in a single work order to decrease the number of physical trips to the data center required to complete the work.

Requests and work orders in dcTrack are subject to validations to ensure consistency in the database. When integrated with an external ticketing system or CMDB, these validations ensure that dcTrack can provide accurate, updated information to the external system.

""Sunbird DCIM 6.0 offers a variety of features that make it faster and easier than ever to complete my most common daily tasks,"" said Joseph Keena, Data Center Manager and six-year dcTrack user. ""The new interactive dashboards provide data center business intelligence that drives deeper insights, more 'what-if scenarios' and more informed decision making to better manage our facilities. The ability to have custom field pick lists mean a higher accuracy of information in these fields, yielding more accurate reporting and metrics. Additionally, the improvements to workflow in the web browser simplify and streamline request and work order approval processes.""

Floor Map Visualizations Increase Visibility into Environmental Factors

In Release 6.0, the 3D thermal floor map visualization and time-lapse video have been enhanced to support vertical as well as horizontal sensors. Users can quickly visualize the thermal gradient in the vertical plane and view additional information with respect to temperature.

A new 3D air pressure floor map overlay with time-lapse video enables users to view visualizations over specific periods so they can quickly spot trends related to airflow uniformity and efficiency. To accurately depict airflow design, perforated tiles can be placed on 3D data center floor maps, with the percentage open configured for each individual tile. Tiles can be tracked as assets, so users can export the data and use it in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applications and other systems.

Patent-Pending Quick Connect Helps Users Create Connections Faster

Sunbird's patent-pending Quick Connect feature allows users to manage connectivity faster and with fewer clicks by making data and power port connections for them. Once a user identifies the start and end points, dcTrack will display the best available connections and, based on the user's selected option, create the circuits automatically.

The connections are weighted and validated based on criteria specific to the ports, such as connector and media type for data port connections and electrical compatibility and current load for power port connections. With Quick Connect, users can create connections without needing to understand the intricate details of the cabling and infrastructure between the connection points.

1,"Confluent Releases KSQL, a Streaming SQL Engine for Apache KafkaTM","Confluent, provider of the leading streaming platform based on Apache KafkaTM, today announced KSQL, an open source streaming SQL engine that enables continuous, interactive queries on Apache Kafka. In today's event-driven world, businesses need to respond to the continuous streams of data that are the source of truth for everything happening within the company. With KSQL, any developer that knows SQL can leverage real-time data. Unlike other stream processing engines that require complex infrastructure or mastery of various programming languages, KSQL gives the user a familiar syntax in an easy-to-manage-and-build solution, while benefiting from Kafka's distributed, scalable and reliable development and production history.

Common examples of stream processing might include comparing two or more streams of data to understand anomalies and respond to them in real time or transforming data as it's ingested to better suit downstream consumers. Stream processing can be used to identify fraud by financial services companies, monitor out-of-bounds system performance metrics, and much more. Other common uses include:

-- Anomaly Detection: Pattern recognition and anomaly detection are real-time and event-driven processes ideally suited to running against streams of data. This can be used horizontally across a number of industries and use cases, for example: financial institutions can alert a bank's users of out-of-the-ordinary transactions, while potentially detecting a security attack.

-- Monitoring: Business are able to move from batch systems to real-time notifications and catch issues in real time that can prevent entire system failures. With KSQL, teams can leverage SQL-like queries to solve problems through the use of a widely-known language while errors are happening, rather than waiting until the next day.

-- Streaming ETL: Companies often have numerous, disparate applications with data that needs to be integrated, standardized and enriched before it can be used in downstream applications or for analysis and reporting. The traditional solution to this batch-oriented process is called ETL (extract, transform, load). With the onset of large scale streams, this process is moving to a real-time world; however, those usually responsible for this function rarely live in a programming world and prefer working with SQL. KSQL enables this group to move forward from batch-processing ETL to doing it in real-time.

""Until now, stream processing has required complex infrastructure, sophisticated developers and a serious investment. Our mission is to make stream processing easily accessible so anyone can derive insights from their streams of data,"" said Neha Narkhede, co-founder and CTO at Confluent. ""With KSQL, stream processing on Apache Kafka is available through a familiar SQL-like interface, rather than only to developers who are familiar with Java or Python. It is the first completely interactive, distributed streaming SQL engine for Apache Kafka."""

1,ALIGNED: Successfully Bringing New Big Data Technologies from Research Into Industry,"After 3 years of collaboration between industry and academia and EUR4 million of funding from the European Commission's Horizon 2020 program, the ALIGNED project has successfully rolled out five trial platforms showcasing its success in applying the latest big-data research findings to solving the problems of industry.

Vienna, Austria, February 02, 2018 --(PR.com)-- The project tackled problems in a wide range of areas, and showed how the latest semantic technologies can help create smarter legal information systems, provide better management of health data and help construct high-quality archaeological and historical datasets. In all of these areas people are struggling to harness the available data and in all of these areas ALIGNED’s semantic and model driven technologies were able to help.

According to Dr Kevin Feeney, of Trinity College Dublin,who coordinated the project, the critical insight is that, in the era of big-data, everybody is struggling with similar problems, “The Internet has made vast quantities of data available to everybody, but the size and complexity of this data is such that new methods and technologies are needed for organising and managing it and for integrating it with software systems. Across all domains – from science, to medicine, publishing and data-intensive business applications – there are exciting new opportunities to apply big-data analytics to reveal new insights and breakthroughs, but existing tools tend to break at scale. Therefore, we have concentrated on developing some of the latest academic research in the area into software tools that can be used in industry. It’s very satisfying to see these tools already being used in production systems in multiple domains to solve real problems.”

Andreas Koller, from the Semantic Web Company, has focused on the PoolParty use case for enriching data quality management in the semantic technology suite and increase productivity in software development with the smart development assistant integrated in ATLASSIAN software development tools.

""We have taken the latest methodes and technologie to bring PoolParty to another level with data quality features our partners and customers have highly requested. The PoolParty software development team productivity has increased with the Smart Development Assistant based on the ALIGNED metamodel which is the basis for the PoolParty design intent ontology DIOPP developed together with the computer science researchers.""

1,LatAm telcos to invest US$1.8bn in big data,"Latin American telcos invested an estimated US$779mn in big data solutions last year and the figure is forecasted to reach US$1.77bn in 2022.

The forecast is based on data from consultancy Frost&Sullivan and cited by José Otero, Latin America and Caribbean director of mobile broadband advocacy group 5G Americas.

Telcos in Brazil and Mexico will spearhead the investments, Otero said during a webinar.

Operators in the region are implementing big data applications to better understand subscriber satisfaction levels and behaviors in order to anticipate consumption trends, which ultimately leads to higher revenues, he said.

Mobile payments technology also represents a good opportunity for telcos, particularly those partnered with banks, since more than half of Latin America's population does not have a bank relationship, Otero added.

According to the executive, there were 28mn m-banking users in the region last year and the figure is expected to reach 180mn in 2022.

Otero underscored that voice services are on decline while data is on the rise. The number of connected devices in Latin America and the Caribbean is predicted to reach 2.5bn in 2025 and the mobile ecosystem is forecasted to contribute with US$360bn to the regional GDP.

Given the expected amount of connected devices, more spectrum needs to be awarded to deploy 5G networks, said Otero. The region's average spectrum allocation stands at 359MHz, not even a third of what the International Telecommunications Union recommends.

Furthermore, most countries in the regions, with the exception of Mexico and Brazil, are behind schedule regarding their digital switchovers.

Otero stressed the importance of LTE since it is the cornerstone of 5G mobile technology. ""The more LTE infrastructure is deployed, the easier it will be to move towards 5G, since many components are reutilized.""

According to Otero, 5G will not replace 4G. In fact, 4G will continue growing since many regions still lack coverage."

1,"The Future Belongs to Organizations with Intelligent Operations, According to New Research from HfS and Accenture","Organizations that leverage Intelligent Operations to make decisions and act in real-time will be best placed to thrive in the future, according to a new report from HfS Research and Accenture (NYSE:ACN).

Based on survey research of 460 respondents across the globe, the report found that organizations which harness the combination of innovative talent, diverse data, and applied intelligence will be in the best position to overcome digital disruption and utilize data-driven insights to drive superior business outcomes and enhance the customer experience.

The move to Intelligent Operations is fast becoming a make-or-break proposition for organizations, with 80 percent surveyed saying they are concerned with disruption and competitive threats, especially from new digitally savvy entrants.

The report reveals that most organizations are currently unable to make data-driven decisions due to a paucity of skills and technology to process data: in nearly 80 percent of respondent organizations, 50 percent to 90 percent of data is reported as unstructured and largely inaccessible.

Half of the organizations surveyed also say their back office is not keeping pace with front office requirements to support digital capabilities and meet evolving customer expectations.

""To win in today's market and ensure future viability, it is essential that organizations capture value quickly, change direction at pace, and shape and deliver new products and services. Organization also need to maximize the use of 'always on' intelligence to sense, predict and act on changing customer and market developments,"" said Debbie Polishook, group chief executive, Accenture Operations.

""Our research suggests technology alone is not a magic bullet. To successfully transform their operations, organizations must take a holistic approach that integrates business process and industry expertise, human ingenuity, and intelligent technologies. This enables the agility, flexibility and responsiveness needed to drive superior decision-making, business outcomes and customer experiences. It's about responding swiftly to change and how to steer a new course with confidence,"" Polishook added.

When it comes to digital disruption, 42 percent of executives report that they see more opportunities than threats now compared with two years ago. A robust customer experience strategy is identified as the most significant driver of operational agility.

""Breaking down the silos between the front and back office is now essential to delivering a modern customer experience. More than half of survey respondents state that it takes months or even years for their business functions to make changes to evolving business needs,"" said Phil Fersht, CEO and chief analyst at HfS Research. ""The market leaders of the future will be businesses that operate on a OneOffice(TM) model: an intelligent, single office characterized by seamless processes and digital capabilities centered on creating, enabling and supporting the customer experience.""

The research suggests the future belongs to organizations with Intelligent Operations that enable them to have a 360-degree view of their operations enabling quicker, insight-led decision making. The five essential components of Intelligent Operations identified by the research include:

1. Innovative talent. The talent of the future will need to bring creative problem solving in addition to digital expertise. Organizations will need a more agile human resources function and a recruiting approach that heavily leverages an open talent marketplace.

2. Data-driven backbone. Organizations need to capitalize on the explosion of structured and unstructured data from multiple sources to gain new insights for the innovative talent to use in order to achieve stronger outcomes.

3. Applied intelligence. Using integrated automation, analytics, and AI-based solutions, organizations need innovative talent who can understand the business problem and then apply the right combination of tools to find the answer.

4. Leveraging the power of the cloud. The cloud will enable the plug-and-play digital services with better integration of diverse data, can scale up and down, and help organizations move toward an as-a-service environment.

5. Smart partnership ecosystem. Organizations of the future will develop symbiotic relationships with start-ups, academia, technology providers and platform players to achieve their goals.

The research is based on the responses of 460 participants from Accenture enterprise clients involved in buying decisions related to technology and services. The respondents were all director level or above; working for organizations with more than $3 billion global annual revenue and spanning diverse geographic locations, including North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific."

1,Bonitasoft Announces Delivery of Its New Application Platform for Multidisciplinary Development Teams,"The Bonita application platform provides new functionalities to create, deploy and manage enterprise-grade business process apps

PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bonitasoft, a global leader in business process management (BPM) solutions, announced today the release of Bonita BPM 7.5, giving technical teams a more advanced set of tools to create enterprise-wide, user-friendly applications. 

With growing attention being paid to strategic digital transformation initiatives, businesses are using Bonita BPM to widen their focus from the bottom line all the way through to the top line for added value through great user experience. 

Applications built on Bonita BPM 7.5 connect personalized user interfaces with efficient, integrated backoffice operations on a single application platform that supports a variety of digital transformation initiatives. 

Although “low-code” is often used in conjunction with the idea of “citizen developers, “ Bonitasoft understands that the real power of low-code lies in the hands of actual developers. Bonita BPM 7.5 gives the entire development team out-of-the-box features and the right level of openness and extensibility for customization, which offers an unbeatable mix for application development: 

tooling to create fully personalized interfaces, web pages, and forms that work across users’ devices collaborative capabilities of teams to model end-to-end business operations, connect them to any enterprise information system, platform, or SaaS, and to run them as applications extension points allowing developers to create, test and deploy new APIs, connectors or new graphical components and widgets 

Bonita BPM 7.5 is now available for download, with some great new features such as integration with SAML 2 for single sign-on (SSO), advanced date and time management, compatibility with the Microsoft Edge browser, connector development with Java 8, and even more features for innovative team collaboration. 

“Groups within large organizations, tasked with using digital technologies to help create new products and services, are often inspired by lean startup thinking. Bonita permits data-driven groups to experiment, test-and-learn, fail fast, and scale fast,” observes Neil Ward-Dutton of MWD Advisors, a UK-based analyst group. 

“You just can’t buy off-the-shelf for all the applications you need to innovate the development and delivery of products and services,” says Miguel Valdes Faura, CEO of Bonitasoft. “And building it from the ground up via custom development just isn’t fast enough to support constant innovation. That’s why our mix of out-of-the box features and extensibility hits a sweet spot in enterprise needs.”"

Employees can navigate through simplified process maps and text based digital standard operating procedural work-instructions, operations team can monitor process performance, management can view the strategy map and business architecture, IT department can view detailed BPMN 2.0 maps with entity touchpoints for automation, and audit group can highlight process risks and analyze downstream impacts of law, regulation or control changes. EPC10's feature rich map settings provide maximum transparency and adaptability while enforcing security, governance and control. 

""Content is already tedious to ensure accuracy, companies need to stop duplicating their effort by capturing the same information within different groups! EPC10 allows a user to centralize it, share it, collaborate around it and provide relevant individualized views; because without involvement and adoption, there will be no transformation!"" says Scott Armstrong, Interfacing's Managing Partner.

Speed of access to knowledge is more important now than ever before. Today's population expects relevant and quality answers immediately with little to no effort to find them. EPC10 offers a personalized mobile-friendly employee portal, available anywhere 24/7 in the cloud and with quick ""Google-like"" full-text search and user-friendly filtering options for more advanced queries.

EPC10's latest collaboration features are highly engaging to foster ongoing innovation and to establish a culture of transformation and continuous improvement. 

Interfacing has invested three years of effort and tens of millions of dollars into its latest EPC10 platform, demonstrating Interfacing's ongoing commitment to sustain a leadership position and continuously innovate within the process management solution market. EPC10 still offers the same robust modeling, analysis & management capabilities as within past versions; however, the new platform is targeted at the everyday employee, because adoption, engagement and collaboration are key aspects of a successful transformation program.

1,Pega Eliminates IT / Business Translation Gap With Launch of Pega Agile Workbench,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass., May 31, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pegasystems Inc. (NASDAQ:PEGA), the software company empowering customer engagement at the world’s leading enterprises, today announced the launch of Pega® Agile Workbench – a new visual application development tool that provides a foolproof way for business and IT to collaborate and bring better software to market faster. Using an intuitive sticky note-like interface, Pega Agile Workbench creates a real-time feedback loop that simplifies communication, speeds iteration, and guides all stakeholders onto an aligned path to digital transformation.

 Pega Agile Workbench is a visual application development tool that provides a better way for business and IT to collaborate and bring better software to market faster. In this screenshot, we demonstrate how the tool gives business users an intuitive way to give feedback or report a bug simply by pinning a digital note - as text, voice, video, or screenshot - directly in the application they are building. 

 

A photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/d7a153c6-7967-4eee-a926-a4bec3989685

While organizations increasingly embrace the benefits of agile development, the struggle to align business and IT goals remains. Businesspeople are most comfortable talking in business terms, while IT staff can get caught up in the intricacies of technology. This often results in numerous miscommunications and misinterpretations with each iteration – causing errors, lost time, cost overruns, and failed projects. Part of Pega® Platform, Pega Agile Workbench picks up where standard agile approaches fall short by providing an intuitive, no-code feedback environment using a common language that anyone in the organization can understand.

Pega Agile Workbench enables business users to give feedback or report a bug simply by pinning a digital note – as text, voice, video, or screenshot – directly in the application they are building. Directions can be as simple as “Move this search box to the top of the screen,” or “Present next best offer at this stage of the process.” Pega automatically translates the feedback notes into a project task or agile artifact within a preferred agile project management tool (including Pega Agile Studio, CA Agile Central, or Atlassian’s JIRA). This creates continuous and seamless hand-offs between business users and IT as they quickly iterate throughout the development process.

This unique real-time agile approach puts business users and IT on the same page – literally and figuratively – resulting in:

More effective collaboration: Organizations break down communications barriers with a visual, code-free interface using a common language that leaves little room for misinterpretation about what businesspeople want.

 Faster go-to-market: Streamlined workflows take agile development out of tedious email chains and deskside conversations and into a centralized feedback loop. This reduces the number of iterations needed, speeds development processes, and gets products to market faster at lower development costs. 

 Better software: By adding new value to existing agile development investments, the real-time agile approach helps developers turbocharge their agile processes to create better applications with fewer errors to meet rising customer expectations.

Pega Agile Workbench is unified in Pega Platform, Pega’s market-leading model-driven application development environment that is proven to develop software 6.4 times faster than traditional methods. It also extends Pega’s unique and proven Directly Capture Objectives (DCO) capabilities to further simplify requirements gathering and cross-team collaboration.

Pega Agile Workbench, which comes fully unified with Pega®Agile Studio, is available for free in June with the newest release of Pega Platform. Users of JIRA and CA Agile Central project management software can integrate these leading third-party tools with Pega Agile Workbench via a downloadable component from the Pega Exchange marketplace.

1,CaseAgile Will Demonstrate Direct Exchange of Native Visio BPMN Diagrams with Leading BPMN Process Engines,"As a part of continuous commitment to Microsoft® technologies, CaseAgile announces a new release of Enterprise Explorer™ software, which supports direct exchange of BPMN diagrams designed in Microsoft® Visio with leading BPMN process engines. CaseAgile will present a live demonstration of Enterprise Explorer™ on upcoming ""BPMN IN ACTION - Meet and Greet"" event organized by The Object Management Group (OMG) in Brussels at June 5, 2017.

Brussels, Belgium, May 27, 2017 --(PR.com)-- Enterprise Explorer™ opens a simple and productive journey for every Visio® user into the wide world of professional business process management (BPM) systems and process automation. By using Enterprise Explorer™, Microsoft® Visio emits executable process semantics fully compatible with official BPMN™ 2.0 standard from OMG® supported by a majority of leading business process management platforms. Every user of Microsoft® Visio now can import BPM models created in dozens of professional BPM suites directly into Visio® and can export models created in Visio® for further execution on all compatible BPM platforms implementing BPMN™ 2.0 standard.

 Full support of BPMN 2.0 is among the prominent and widely acclaimed features of Microsoft® Visio 2016. The remarkable simplicity of process modeling, combined with strict compliance to BPMN™ 2.0 standard and built-in validation of diagrams, explains the popularity of Visio® process mapping among both BPM practitioners and regular office workers just beginning the journey into the intriguing world of business processes and automation of a digital workplace. However, Visio® itself does not support exchange of BPMN diagrams with other tools. The new release of Enterprise Explorer removes these awkward limitations entirely. Users can draw BPMN models in standard Visio® Professional and then exchange them transparently with any other BPMN tool. No Visio® plugin is necessary to achieve this.

 ""BPMN IN ACTION - Meet and Greet"" event organized by The Object Management Group (OMG) will feature live demonstration of exchange of Visio BPMN diagrams with tools of other vendors by using Enterprise Explorer™.

1,"Information Builders Unveils iWay Big Data Integrator, Developer's Edition","NEW YORK, Aug. 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Information Builders, a leader in business intelligence (BI) and analytics, data integrity, and integration solutions, announced the release of a Developer's Edition of its iWay Big Data Integrator. This limited edition enables developers to test the features of Hadoop® and Apache Spark™ for their big data integration projects without the need for extensive knowledge or training in Hadoop, and accelerate time to value for big data projects.

Organizations have access to more data than ever before to improve operations and boost profitability. However, due to the many technical obstacles that can arise – such as the complexity of Hadoop and the challenges of managing data quality – a majority of big data projects fail. iWay Big Data Integrator addresses these fundamental challenges by enabling organizations to take a modern, native approach to Hadoop-based data integration and management with an intuitive interface that allows you to move data in and around Hadoop without custom coding or scripting.

Key product highlights include:

Simplified ingestion, replacement, and de-duplication of data sets using pipelines or native Spark, Flume support, and other techniques ­– all without programing Native Hadoop performance and resource negotiation by running under YARN's cluster management technology Support for a variety of big data integration use cases, including structured, defined, and streaming sources in batch and real-time via Spark and Hadoop Spark data operations allow organizations to shape data, while Hive and HQL transformations enable you to modify or join tables Improved security and encryption, with sophisticated process management and governance to the Hadoop ecosystem

With iWay Big Data Integrator, real-time and static big data sources can quickly be integrated, contextualized, and analyzed, allowing organizations to capitalize on the data's potential, support downstream business processes, identify opportunities for data monetization, and enrich customer relationships.

Gerald Cohen, president and CEO, Information Builders, said: 

""The insights gleaned from big data sets can offer tremendous value to organizations of all types, but historically companies have struggled to unlock its potential. With iWay Big Data Integrator, businesses can finally concentrate on what they hope to use Hadoop for instead of struggling with new developer tools or the need for specific skills. I would invite developers to experience the ease with which iWay Big Data Integrator can help to manage big data faster than ever before, allowing them to more efficiently transform data into valuable insights that help drive business forward."""

1,Cohesity Orion Release Provides Industry’s First Storage Platform to Consolidate Data Protection and Big Data Repositories on One Infrastructure That Scales Without Limits,"London, UK - - Cohesity, the pioneer of hyperconverged secondary storage, today announced the launch of Cohesity Orion 5.0, the industry's first storage platform that combines end-to-end data protection and big data storage on distributed, infinitely scalable architecture. The latest version of Cohesity's groundbreaking secondary storage platform delivers radical efficiency by serving double duty as a backup solution and searchable archive for large amounts of structured and unstructured data. By combining historically siloed solutions on a single platform that works across cloud and on-premises infrastructure, Cohesity Orion enables companies to simplify administration, reduce overall data copies, accelerate search and retrieval, and dramatically lower storage costs.

Companies have traditionally relied on one set of point solutions for data backup and recovery and another set to archive vast quantities of structured and unstructured data, ranging from customer records to large-scale media content. But with the increasing size and diversity of data that organisations need to store, these separate infrastructures have led to massive inefficiencies. Copies of the same data accumulate on each point solution, and administrators must work across multiple user interfaces to handle separate data use cases.

Cohesity Orion 5.0 tackles these inefficiencies head on by providing an industry-first platform for data protection and archiving that seamlessly spans on-premises and cloud infrastructure and can be managed through a simple, single-pane-of-glass user interface. The fully indexed and searchable platform gives IT administrators easier access and greater insight into their data and eliminates redundant copies. Data is now instantly accessible to any application and user via standard protocols including NFS, CIFS/SMB, and S3. This drives extremely efficient data and infrastructure re-use across data protection, archive, content repositories, test/dev, and analytic workloads.

""Cohesity helped us to easily back up the growing critical and mandatory-to-save data, like police department videos from their vehicle and body cameras, and made those files instantaneously available upon request,"" said Ben Price, director of administrative and residential IT at the University of California, Santa Barbara. ""From backup to recovery, analytics to monitoring and alerting, Cohesity consolidated everything under a simple, easy-to-access user interface.""

In addition, Cohesity's platform scales incrementally to cover companies' overall storage needs as they increase or decrease, instead of requiring administrators to set up separate environments for each specific workload. It also eliminates the need to monitor and manage these different architectures, freeing up time to focus on innovation rather than maintenance. To ensure that the platform continues to serve customers as quickly as they grow, Cohesity Orion demonstrated linear, non-disruptive scaling through 256 nodes, 3 petabytes capacity, and 80 GB/s throughput in a recent test conducted by the Taneja Group.

Enhanced Capabilities Open New Markets for Hyperconverged Secondary Storage

The latest Cohesity release adds important new capabilities that further advance its mission to offer a single hyperconverged platform that can handle any secondary data use case. Its new C3000 Dense Nodes improve storage capacity by a factor of seven and rack density by a factor of two, and are ideal for large content repositories or data protection workloads that require the lowest storage cost per terabyte, such as media content or financial and medical records.

Key enhancements to support archiving for any type of content:

- Simultaneous multiprotocol access to content via NFS, CIFS/SMB, and S3 protocols

- Global in-line deduplication and compression across all content, including the industry's first and only deduplicated S3 object storage

- Global indexing and search for rapid retrieval

- File system and user quotas with audit logs

""Together, Cohesity and ACS recently closed a large deal with a leading U.S. healthcare provider to consolidate more than 20 standalone backup servers into a simplified, scale-out solution that cut backup time windows in half,"" said Kevin C. Prahm, vice president of sales and operations at ACS US (Applied Computer Solutions). ""Cohesity recoveries are now seconds rather than hours, and together we saved our client over 50 percent in costs compared to continuing with their legacy vendor. We're excited to see the fifth generation of Cohesity data protection software now expanding to include the massive content storage required by our largest healthcare accounts for retention of critical patient data.""

Key enhancements to expand data protection capabilities:

- Ability to back up hypervisors beyond VMware vSphere, including Microsoft Hyper-V, Nutanix AHV, and Linux KVM

- Ability to back up NAS devices beyond NetApp, including EMC Isilon, Pure Storage Flashblade, and any generic NAS, for both NFS and CIFS/SMB file systems

- New file-level backups for physical Linux servers, in addition to volume-based backups, and bare-metal restores for Windows servers

MicroStrategy 10.9 delivers Dossier, an interactive book of business which combines relevant analytics into a single place, organized into chapters and pages.

Anyone who has access to a dossier through the MicroStrategy Library(TM) can ask questions, highlight trends, and share their current filter state with others. Users who are tagged in a comment can receive real-time notifications via email, browser banners, page and library alerts, or push notifications.

MicroStrategy Library Helps Users Quickly and Easily Find Content and Answers

The 10.9 release delivers the MicroStrategy Library, a personalized portal for all users to access their BI content and dossiers. End users can login to the MicroStrategy Library to find a list of all dossiers to which he or she has subscribed or has access.

Analysts can author once and deploy on multiple devices, without worrying about the target device.

Dossier and Document Certification Maintain Effective Data Governance

With MicroStrategy 10.9, analysts and data stewards can watermark content with a 'certified' stamp. This step offers an easy way to implement governance across a self-service deployment and makes it clear for business users whcih content is tied to trusted data sources.

New Connectivity, Including Enhanced Out-of-the-box Connectors, to Diverse Types of Data

MicroStrategy 10.9 amplifies existing investments by keeping up with the latest certifications and providing instant access to nearly any type of data with out-of-the-box connectors to popular data sources, including personal spreadsheets, enterprise data warehouses, text files, cloud sources, and big data systems.

In addition, MicroStrategy 10.9 delivers an SDK to build out new out-of-the-box connectors that help analysts visualize text and semi-structured data such as Solr, Box, One Drive, Elasticsearch and many others. These new connectors allow analysts and citizen data scientists to run queries against semi-structured data, like log files and text scripts. Data is available to end users in tabular format and can be readily used to build reports or dossiers. New connectors built using the Data Connector API are regularly available and can be downloaded by visiting the MicroStrategy Community.

New Embedding APIs Easily Integrate Dossiers into Websites, Blogs and Portals

Offering a vast array of APIs, MicroStrategy 10 is an open platform that works with larger technology ecosystems and offers easy ways to extend its capabilities. With MicroStrategy 10.9's new embedding APIs, dossiers can be easily embedded into third-party applications with the ability to interact with MicroStrategy content and associated functionality. Users can slice and dice the data, navigate to different pages and chapters in the dossier, apply filters, and interact and analyze the data within the application itself. In addition, single sign-on or guest embedding can be enabled, so the user can interact with the dossier without having to login within the third-party application.

""After testing MicroStrategy 10.9 as an early adopter, we are excited about the new set of APIs in the release that will make embedding and integration of MicroStrategy capabilities with applications of our choice easier,"" said Praphul Kumar, Senior Director of Product Management, Genesys. ""As we create the world's most powerful, personal and intelligent customer experiences, MicroStrategy helps us to democratize those experiences through their rich set of APIs. We use MicroStrategy APIs to embed real-time and historical information right into the hands of contact center agents and supervisors so they can view and analyze that information in any application.

1,Independent Research Reports Name Teradata a Leader in Customer Journey Analytics,"SAN DIEGO, Oct. 5, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Teradata (NYSE: TDC), the leading data and analytics company, has been named a leader in Customer Journey Analytics in two Forrester WAVE reports – one for Visioning, and the other for Orchestration. Forrester is careful to emphasize that journey analytics is not a tool, but ""an analytics practice that combines quantitative and qualitative data to analyze customer behaviors and motivations across touchpoints and over time to optimize customer interactions and predict future behavior."" The two reports are The Forrester Wave™: Customer Journey Analytics Visioning Platforms, Q3 2017 and The Forrester Wave™: Customer Journey Analytics Orchestration Platforms, Q3 2017.* 

Per Forrester: ""[The visioning platforms evaluation is] weighted heavier on journey design and planning (sharing maps and insights, creating current- and future-state maps, co-creation and ideation, and discovery of segments and personas)"" and the orchestration platforms evaluation is ""weighted heavier on journey automation and orchestration (workflow automation, journey orchestration, and integration)."" 

Forrester positioned Teradata as a leader in the two Waves, and noted it for ""combine(ing) analytic data sources, databases, and data from real-time digital interactions to identify problems in the journey, size them, calculate the business value of fixing them, and orchestrate(ing) actions across teams, for large volumes of data."" Forrester notes that the Teradata platform ""…integrates well with big data sources; has strong real-time analysis, real-time decisioning, and predictive capabilities; and, according to reference customers, focuses on simplification and reducing time to insights.""

""I believe that Forrester's evaluation validates the good feedback we hear from our customers. They acknowledge our significant strengths in data integration, advanced analytics and multi-channel interaction management. Customer Journey Analytics has become the most important space for technology enablement as consumers shop diligently across channels and expect quick, precise responses,"" said Chris Twogood, Senior Vice President, Marketing at Teradata. ""In addition, we are introducing new functionality, which facilitates action based on deeper insights at higher speed – so opportunities can become business outcomes in minutes, not days.""

As these WAVE reports were published, Teradata announced new enhancements to its Customer Journey Program. The new capabilities augment many of Teradata's existing assets identified in Forrester's report, such as a centralized command center for faster access to business insights and the self-sufficiency to access and act on analytic insights in real time, without the need to engage technical resources. 

New features include:

Operationalizing Analytics to provide marketers quick access to analytic insights via dynamic visuals makes it easy to act on those insights in real time, without depending on data scientists or IT. Using graphical techniques, marketers can visualize the customer journey to better understand the most travelled paths and inflection points, and with simple point and click access, offer compelling interactions along the way. Open Analytics with ""R"" based Predictive Models allows data scientists to view the models used for real time decision arbitration, thereby proving them transparency into the decisioning process. This ""open"" approach to analytics increases confidence and therefore adoption of the self-learning models, freeing analytic resources for other analytic challenges. Centralized Marketing Command Center gives marketers a single point of access to real-time insights, allowing them to manage performance in a consistent manner across a variety of focus areas such as customer acquisition, growth, retention and customer experience. These metrics, enabled by underlying analytics, ensure standardization of KPIs across business units, and make it easier for marketers to pinpoint the reasons for, and areas of, poor ROI. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Compliance to ensure Teradata's Customer Journey clients are acquiescent with regulatory requirement in advance of the May 2018 deadline. GDPR requires that businesses must get, and be able to prove, customer consent before collecting their information. It also gives customers the right to data portability and the right to be forgotten. The new capability provides customer decision traceability and encryption of contact history for open, transparent records of marketing campaigns. Customer Journey ""Everywhere"" grants marketing organizations significant flexibility with their system architecture, deployment options and purchasing models. Existing or previous investments are protected from future disasters by allowing early, unrestricted portability of licenses from on-premises to public and private cloud options. 

Teradata's Customer Journey solution continues to improve scalability and performance of real time decisions to enable fast market entry and is available immediately, worldwide. Many of these new features are already included in the solution, while others become available this fall.

The transaction remains subject to customary conditions and is expected to close in the coming weeks.

Data Virtualisation helps knowledge workers to quickly discover and access their own views of corporate data in an automated, intelligent way.

The next generation of business intelligence depends on doing more with analytics than just putting data on a graph. Data Virtualisation is a key component of getting the right data at the right time to business analysts, data scientists, and automated applications using streaming analytics.

The addition of the Data Virtualisation business will enable TIBCO analytics users, including TIBCO Spotfire customers, to improve data agility for faster responses to ever-changing analytics and business intelligence needs, reduce data complexity for enhanced scalability, and drive better business insights.

1,Independent Research Firm Cites OpenText as a Leader in Enterprise Content Management for Transactional and Business Content Services,"Transactional Report Cites OpenText's Hybrid Approach, and Notes the Company Continues to Execute on its Strategy to Embed Content and Process Services into Core Business Systems

WATERLOO, Ontario, April 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- OpenText™ (NASDAQ: OTEX, TSX: OTEX), a global leader in Enterprise Information Management (EIM), today announced that analyst firm Forrester Research, Inc. (NASDAQ: FORR) has named OpenText a Leader in its Wave evaluations of Enterprise Content Management (ECM) for Transactional Content Services as well as Business Content Services1.

1,Alfresco Recognized as a Leader and a Strong Performer in Enterprise Content Management Platforms for Business and Transactional Services by Independent Research Firm,"Alfresco Acknowledged for Delivering Openness, Interoperability, and Hybrid Deployment Options in Business Content Services Evaluation.

SAN MATEO, Calif. & MAIDENHEAD, England--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Open-source pioneer, Alfresco Software, announced the company was named a Leader in The Forrester Wave™: Enterprise Content Management - Business Content Services, Q2 2017 evaluation. Alfresco also debuted a Strong Performer in The Forrester Wave™: Enterprise Content Management - Transactional Content Services, Q2 2017 evaluation. 

In the Wave reports, Forrester predicts strong momentum for the ECM sector: “Forrester forecasts enterprise content management to be a global market worth $8 billion in 2017, rising to $9 billion in 2018. Deployment plans remain healthy, with nearly 90% of current ECM decision makers planning to expand their rollouts over the next year.” 

A critical driver for this growth are enterprise business transformation and modernization strategies, including cloud-first initiatives. In addition, delivering fast and contextual access to content for both internal and external stakeholders is critical, as is increasing user experience and collaboration capabilities. 

The Forrester Wave™: ECM Business Content Services, Q2 2017 evaluation states : “Alfresco continues to lure customers away from incumbent ECM providers in both the public and private sector. Ongoing investments in its BPM portfolio as well as cloud partnerships, such as with Amazon, position it as a credible alternative for organizations that want a modern, open source- and open standards-based content and process services platform.” 

“We are thrilled with Alfresco’s performance in both EMC Waves. Being named a leader in The Forrester Wave ECM BCS Evaluation and a Strong Performer in The Forrester Wave ECM TCS Evaluation is, in our opinion, a continuous recognition of Alfresco being at the forefront of the digital platform innovation. We are honored with these accolades and look forward to helping the market, and our customers accelerate their digital transformation initiatives,” said Thomas DeMeo, Alfresco Vice President of Product Management. “We believe Alfresco’s strong capabilities in both ECM segments validates our approach to meeting the requirements of broad industry use cases. As organizations progress on their digital journeys, we offer solutions that deliver greater content in context, giving end users information when and where they need it.” 

The Forrester Wave: ECM Transactional Content Services, Q2 2017 report examines platforms that manage high-volume content that typically originates outside the organization, like customer claims and invoices. Forrester reports about Alfresco: “Clients report a high level of satisfaction with its APIs, life-cycle management, metadata, and BPM integration capabilities.” 

In both evaluations, Alfresco achieved the second highest score for user adoption (tied in the Business Content Services evaluation). In the Business Content Services Wave, Forrester notes: “Investments in an updated partner program and customer success program have resulted in solid customer retention rates.”

1,"ECM is Evolving, Not Facing Extinction","PARSIPPANY, N.J., April 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- According to Micro Strategies, new and impending regulations across the financial sector are causing businesses to rethink their content management strategies. Reports show that the Enterprise Content Management (ECM) market remains strong at around $5.5 billion in license and subscription revenue per year and between an estimated 7 percent to 8 percent annual growth.  While some industry pundits predict that ECM is facing extinction, it is actually undergoing what could be classified as a revamping. According to Gartner, content services applications will replace traditional enterprise content management suites in a quarter of large enterprises by 2020.

Across financial, government, healthcare and other industry sectors, the term ECM is being replaced with content services, which industry analysts say better illustrates the purpose of the approach. When ECM was first introduced, it was designed to help business productivity through simplifying and integrating content management processes, with the goal of enabling businesses to develop content management applications alongside other systems. However, traditional models developed holes where end-user adoption was concerned, forcing this process to evolve in a rapidly changing marketplace. 

Nowadays, software solutions companies are introducing 'content services' platforms that accommodate new needs of scalability and seamlessness. For example, Micro Strategies Docs Now Content Services is a 100 percent private cloud based, scalable solution that can be implemented within one week, and grows alongside an organization or department, currently being used by small to mid-sized businesses and Fortune 500 corporations.

When adopting 'content services', businesses are generally aiming to excel in the areas of: the retention and spreading of business knowledge, cost and time efficiency, regulatory compliance and risk management, and innovation.1 Single monolithic approaches haven't led to full-scale success, as many providers struggled to keep up with the need for agile cloud-based deployment, and rapid innovation.  In summary, legacy ECM solutions hosted in the cloud haven't successfully tackled emerging use cases – thus, 'content services' have become a  more strategic approach covering a broader range of aspects – content services applications, platforms, and components.

Adam Storch, VP of Business Solutions at leading software solutions provider, Micro Strategies, comments: ""The idea is that content services can accomplish the objectives set out by the older versions of ECM. What this picture looks like is the agile assimilation of data and maintenance of appropriate governance and compliance levels which addresses emerging business needs and innovations.

Storch continues: ""Alongside the demands of this changing Business Process Management (BPM) environment, Micro Strategies' new DocsNow content services solution enables organizations to securely jumpstart their enterprise content management (ECM) solution in the cloud. The reality is that Content Services solutions are needed by all organizations, in order to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and allow their employees to work efficiently. The DocsNow platform can integrate with existing solutions, as well as easily and seamlessly add Process Services (BPM) without halting operations -- a necessity in today's digital economy.""

1,New Google BigQuery benchmark helps enterprises assess emerging options for Business Intelligence on Big Data,"SAN MATEO, Calif., April 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- AtScale, the first company to provide enterprises with a fast and secure self-service Business Intelligence platform for Big Data, released today the results of a Business Intelligence benchmark for Google BigQuery. The benchmark results can be viewed at www.atscale.com/bigquery

The study, which evaluated Google BigQuery performance for key Business Intelligence (BI) workloads, reveals key insights that enterprise IT leaders should consider when modernizing their business intelligence infrastructure.  

Big Data's ""New Normal"": Heterogeneous & Hybrid

Enterprise CIOs are increasingly having to accommodate the reality of a complex Big Data world: the average employee expects to connect to any enterprise data with consistent speed, security and scale from any BI tool.  However, enterprise IT stores data in multiple data stores, each of which has different deployment models and delivery speeds: Hadoop on-premises, Hadoop in the Cloud, RDBMSs on-premises, and databases in the Cloud.  

As enterprise buyers weigh which technologies to deploy, it is essential to consider the ramifications their choices will have for their users.  For instance, the benchmark results show that Google BigQuery's serverless architecture enables IT departments to quickly launch a Big Data service without the need to manage scalability.  However, these new serverless architectures also require customers to consider the types of queries that will be run on this new platform.  Queries with high-complexity and numerous table joins tend to perform differently on BigQuery than on traditional Hadoop systems.  Additionally, different big data platforms handle filtered query results using varied approaches, resulting in differences in performance profiles across these solutions.

""The AtScale benchmark provides enterprise leaders with useful comparisons they need in order to make BI work on Big Data. As the data world grows more complex and diverse, these benchmark stats help enterprises understand leading Big Data query options and make better decisions critical to supporting BI infrastructure,"" says Doug Henschen, Vice President and Principal Analyst at Constellation Research.

This benchmark aims to shed a light on the performance of Google BigQuery in comparison with other more traditional SQL-on-Hadoop engines.  In performing the benchmark, AtScale focused on the success criteria that satisfy enterprise Business Intelligence requirements, namely:

Performs on Big Data: The database engine must be able to consistently analyze billions or trillions of rows of data without generating errors and with response times on the order of 10s or 100s of seconds. Fast on Small Data: The engine needs to deliver interactive performance on known query patterns and return results in no greater than several seconds on small data sets (on the order of thousands or millions of rows). Stable for Many Users: Enterprise BI user bases consist of hundreds or thousands of data workers and as a result, the underlying query engine must perform reliably under highly concurrent analysis workloads.

Some of the benchmark findings include:

Data loading: The process of moving data to the Google cloud and loading it into BigQuery was simple and well-documented. Management: The BigQuery management console, query tools, and documentation make the product easy to use and support rapid on-boarding. Out-of-the-box performance: The BigQuery engine performs quite well ""out-of-the-box"", requiring minimal query tuning and no system configuration. Impressive concurrency: BigQuery serverless model means concurrent query performance on small data sets shows no query degradation, even at query volumes above 25 concurrent BI users.

""These results of this benchmark indicate a rapid evolution in the Big Data market,"" says Matt Baird, CTO and co-founder at AtScale. ""Such a pace can be daunting for enterprises as they are already dealing with a fair amount of complexity: should they use Hadoop?  Should they use BigQuery?  What's the difference between on-premise Hadoop, in-cloud Hadoop and a serverless model like Google's?""  

These new developments are indeed an indication that the Big Data market has matured to its tipping point and that platform vendors like Google have become a viable solution to add to an enterprise's arsenal mix.  

This benchmark also offers insights for how enterprises can deploy Business Intelligence on any data, without compromising experience and speed.  As enterprise CIOs' data investment spans across heterogeneous and hybrid data environments, they will have to set a bar for performance across all systems. They will also need to look for a solution that simplifies the complex and brings order to their Big Data chaos."

1,"ZirMed's Coverage Detection Solution Identifies Hidden Health Insurance Coverage to Help Providers Collect More Revenue



Advanced technology empowers providers to manage the rising self-pay population better, reduce bad debt and increase cash flow","ZirMed Inc., a recognized leader in cloud-based revenue cycle software and predictive analytics, today announced the launch of its next generation Coverage Detection solution which includes significant enhancements that improve the overall solution and user experience, expand the healthcare provider markets it serves, and drive even more return on investment for ZirMed clients.

The solution helps providers to manage the ever-increasing population of self-pay patients more effectively--often cited as the largest contributor to bad debt in healthcare. ZirMed's technology automatically discovers whether patients have health insurance coverage, even if they present as self-pay or are unable to provide insurance information due to acute events, enabling providers to submit billing to payers and get paid faster, more completely and with less effort.

Preliminary results show that ZirMed's sophisticated business intelligence engine delivers a hit rate of 5 to 15 percent--well above the 1 to 5 percent success rate achieved by manual methods and legacy vendors. That substantially higher percent of discovery translates into millions of dollars in revenue recoupment for providers.

Rising bad debt puts revenue at risk

While bad debt has always been concerning for providers, it has become more urgent with the proliferation of high-deductible health plans, the consumerization of healthcare and the resulting surge in the self-pay population. According to a 2016 Healthcare Financial Management Association survey, hospitals have seen a 10 percent median increase in self-pay dollars over the last five years. 97 percent of hospitals reported an increase in self-pay receivables over the prior year.

These statistics are problematic because it is twice as expensive for providers to collect payment from patients as it is from payers. With this unprecedented rise of self-pay patients, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services also predicts unprecedented growth for hospital-based bad debt, with the number ballooning to $200 billion by 2019.

Uncovering coverage to help providers get paid

The Coverage Detection solution is powered by ZirMed's robust repository of data, which contains billions of healthcare transactions from across the continuum of care, including historical data on health insurance coverage for 1 in 8 patients in America. By leveraging predictive analytics, proprietary algorithms, and advanced payer logic, the solution uncovers actionable insights--highlighting patients who have active coverage and enabling providers to collect the revenue that they are owed more effectively and efficiently.

""ZirMed is committed to understanding not only our customers' challenges but also the larger industry trends that will impact their revenue in 2017 and beyond. As always, our goal is to help providers get reimbursed for the care that they're delivering. Getting providers paid is our mission--and we take that mission incredibly seriously. Our mission-driven culture is why over 300,000 providers and more than 500 hospitals rely on us every day,"" said Ric Sinclair, ZirMed's Vice President of Product.

This new software licensing model is the first in the hybrid cloud market to feature portability — a shift away from cloud lock-in or siloed on-premises deployments. With this new facility, Teradata's customers can develop an analytic solution on the on-premises system — Intelliflex — and later port the same to the cloud facility, Intellicloud. Sunil Jose, Managing Director, Teradata India, said: The new facility ""delivers lower up-front costs and, with a consistent operating expenses model, makes it easier for customers to budget and predict spending patterns."""

The global ICT research and consulting services firm expects the region to see year-on-year growth of 11.0 per cent in 2017 to reach $2.20 billion. The growth is expected to continue over the coming years to reach approximately $3.20 billion in 2020, which represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.0 per cent over the 2016-20 period.

When it comes to the technologies used in BDA implementations, a large portion of investment is focused on IT and business services followed by software. Indeed, IT and business services alone accounted for 55.1 per cent of overall spending.

""This highlights that organisations in the region clearly face challenges in finding skills to support big data and analytics deployments, and rely heavily on partners to support them until the solution goes into production,"" says Megha Kumar, research director for software at IDC MEA. ""Spending on software in the BDA space is focused on solutions for end-user query and reporting and databases."" ""Organisations in the region acknowledge the need to leverage data for taking strategic decisions,"" continues Kumar. ""There is a lot of focus around customer analytics and operational analytics to gain insights on customers and improve overall performance. While there is uptake around advanced and predictive workloads, it is very clear that many industries are still struggling to understand the use cases they can leverage within their sector."" In terms of industries, the government sector (both state and federal/local government) was the largest spender on BDA solutions in MEA in 2016, accounting for 20.4 per cent of spending. It was followed by the financial sector (19.2 per cent) and telecommunications (13.3 per cent). Other industries with longer-term potential include manufacturing (both discrete and processed manufacturing), healthcare provider, resource industries, utilities, and transportation.

Industries that have shown very little BDA spending include construction, personal and consumer services, and media. The finance, healthcare, and government are the fastest growing sectors, with all three expected to grow at CAGRs of around 12 per cent over the course of the forecast period.

From a geographical perspective, more than 24 per cent of the MEA regions BDA investment in 2016 was generated in Saudi Arabia, followed by South Africa and the UAE, with shares of 22.7 per cent and 17.2 per cent, respectively. Turkey accounted for 15.6 per cent share, with the remainder split between the rest of MEA countries.

""As alluded to earlier, BDA adoption in the region is rising with organisations seeking embedded analytics within applications,"" says Kumar. ""Advanced and predictive workloads will give rise to demand for skills such as data scientists."""

 BPM tools are operational performance enablers that allow fund administrators to design, monitor and execute end-to-end business processes for increased efficiency. With business operations becoming increasingly exception based and event-driven, intelligent operations require a more responsive approach.

Orchard's institutional clients can use depersonalized credit data for ongoing monitoring of borrower creditworthiness for loans in existing portfolios.

""Access to Experian's depersonalized credit data adds immediate value to our clients, whether they are looking to buy, sell or hold loans,"" said Orchard's chief commercial officer Bill Ullman. ""Typically, a borrower's creditworthiness is captured for loans at a particular point in time — when the lender is making a decision. Experian makes it possible to monitor the anonymous credit data of borrowers, in an ongoing and privacy-friendly way. We are excited to work with Experian, the industry leader, to provide our clients with the data they need to make better-informed decisions when using Orchard's analytics and transactional platform.""

Delivering greater transparency, high-quality data and analytical tools to the market is central to the mission of both companies. Orchard's institutional clients should benefit from the use of Experian data to not only make more informed investment decisions through refined credit modeling but also through the ability to manage risks more effectively with more current loan data. Experian has been harnessing the power of data for many years to help consumers, financial institutions and governmental organizations make more informed and effective decisions. Raw data without the right level of interpretation is nothing more than untapped potential.

""We are confident that our expertise, combined with the technological strength that Orchard Platform provides, will give institutional investors and loan originators access to previously unavailable credit data and empower them to make better investment decisions.

1,Predictive Analytics: Reaching Those Left Behind by Traditional Banking,"Two significant target audiences are falling outside the reach of traditional banking services, and financial institutions that proactively leverage customer relationship management and marketing automation tools could capture both.

While it may seem an odd dichotomy, banking's unserved/underserved class and the high-net-worth segment offer tremendous opportunity for financial institutions to better serve these sectors. Surprisingly, more than a quarter of the U.S. population is unbanked or underbanked, with little or no access to the traditional financial services of checking or savings accounts, lines of credit or credit cards.

At the other end of the spectrum, high-net-worth individuals tend to be an exclusive group who typically avoid wealth management firms.

However, CRM and predictive analytics can offer a deeper understanding of who these potential customers are and their financial needs. And that could mean better, broader service offerings and more customers.

Woefully Underserved

Among the 9 million nonbanked U.S. households, 57.4 percent cite the inability to meet minimum account balance requirements and the perception of high, unpredictable banking fees as the main obstacles to traditional banking services. Additionally, this often peripatetic group can be tough to reach via traditional marketing efforts.

Banks would benefit from taking a deeper look into who these potential customers are.

""Financial institutions need to help underserved communities improve their financial literacy,"" says Kerri Moriarty of financial planner Cinch Financial. ""By helping them with education, financial institutions can aid them, and these people will become better customers, with fewer defaults and better margins.""

Banks should strive to make the underserved aware of secured credit cards or simple, lower-interest cards and one-time overdraft protection. If credit card companies increased marketing efforts for responsible debt management vehicles, customers would be better informed of products that can help improve their overall financial health.

""Financial institutions are good about understanding their customers on the loan side,"" says MelAnn Sullivan of Bank On South Alabama, an initiative which brings together institutions willing to provide checking and saving account options to an underserved population. ""But they do a poor job of understanding their customers on the deposit side. They often don't classify people opening savings or checking accounts as low-, medium-or high-income. There is an opportunity for financial institutions to use data to gain a more comprehensive, well-rounded customer view.""

Dan Henry, former CEO of prepaid debit card operator NetSpend agrees. ""There is no substitute for good data and analytics when it comes to understanding the needs of the underserved. Data was vital in enabling NetSpend to identify its highest-margin clients and grow revenues from $128 million to more than $600 million.""

At the High End

High net-worth individuals, notes Drew Cerullo, owner/ CEO of Better Profit Growth, are equally challenging, for different reasons.

""Because these individuals have more disposable income than most, their perspectives on money and spending differ significantly from the average American,"" says Cerullo. ""They have different habits and mindsets and in order to reach them effectively, efforts must be highly targeted and customized.""

This elite group is skeptical of authority, preferring to seek counsel from an expert viewed as a trusted source rather than a wealth management advisor. They expect the ability to access information anywhere and anytime. To win over these affluent customers, wealth managers must identify and market highly tailored services.

Banks and wealth management firms simply offering the services will not sway them.

""One of the most common mistakes is firms pursuing the wrong or unfocused avenues to reach target audiences,"" said Lauren Hong, president of financial marketing company Out & About. ""The results are often minimal.""

A Shared Solution

There is a shared need for financial institutions to better understand and target these disparate groups. By leveraging CRM and marketing automation tools, banks can deploy powerful predictive analytics to reach these potential customers.

CRM solutions, such as Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Salesforce, offer enhanced marketing analytic capabilities, making them more powerful than ever. Lead-scoring solutions using advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms can process trillions of consumer attributes, providing a full understanding of an individual. This analysis can then deliver accurate scores, ranking a lead's propensity to convert from prospect to locked-in client.

This 360-degree view will offer insight into an individual's likelihood to purchase or engage with a business and provide marketers with access to actionable intelligence. Understanding a prospect's behavior and choices will enable banking professionals to present the services and products with the most appeal.

Finally, predictive analytics can assist in retaining existing customers. Imagine a customer whose company becomes publicly traded and suddenly receives a profit-sharing windfall or stock-purchase opportunity. Financial-service providers can and should address this dramatic shift. CRM systems can help clue financial firms into customers' significant life events and quickly enable marketing managers to offer increasingly precise services.

It's easy to lose sight of those who don't fit neatly into banking categories. While most needs are met, there are millions of people on both ends of the spectrum who can benefit from more-tailored offerings. Leveraging predictive analytics can help financial services providers increase their customer base and bottom line. IBN"
1,IQLECT Launches World's Fastest and Most Cost-effective Predictive Real-time Data Analytics Platform on Cloud,"BANGALORE, July 5, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --

The data analytics startup, IQLECT (http://www.iqlect.com) has launched its software converged, SSD optimized, real-time predictive data analytics platform on cloud to help companies optimize their business using the data insights in real time. The platform comes fully loaded with various domain-specific apps (solutions) hosted on IQLECT's app store for accelerated time to market. IQLECT aims to operate in Infrastructure, IOT and Fintech domains.

     (Photo: http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/530480/IQLECT_Data_Analytics_Real_time_and_Predictive.jpg )

IQLECT has designed and implemented the entire software stack from ground up to address the newer challenges of data analytics where the demand for actionable real-time insights is growing rapidly. The basic premise for IOT and predictive analysis is also to be able to capture and analyze data in real time where a plethora of devices, sensors, appliances, servers, web, log files, etc. are generating a large amount of unstructured data, which carry highly useful perishable insights that could be lost if not analyzed in real time.

IQLECT has developed its own high performance, multi-flavored NoSQL database called BangDB, to solve the ingestion and processing of a large amount of data in a scalable and performant manner. Software convergence avoids the typical multiple silos which exist as bottleneck with most of the options in the market. This allows the platform to perform truly in real time and at the same time, scale for large volumes of data in an efficient manner. Being data agnostic in nature allows the platform to ingest different heterogeneous sets of data at one place, thus enabling the complex correlation or event processing to find interesting patterns, which could be difficult with existing tools and other platforms.

IQLECT simplifies the offering with converged, unified platform that can be offered on cloud as SaaS or shipped to enterprise for private deployments. Thus, allowing users to start small and grow as they need. Further with the ready to go apps, companies can begin within minutes to start dealing with real-time insights. Whereas, most of the players in the market either use big iron appliance, which cost millions of dollars to just get started. On the other hand, one needs to stitch different software pieces, all designed for different purposes, to create a platform, which usually takes very long time to see the light of the day.

""We are very excited about this platform launch. This is a big step towards making the real-time data analytics simple and affordable for all,"" says Sachin Sinha, CEO of IQLECT. IQLECT was founded by Sachin Sinha in 2015, who also designed and wrote the BangDB, one of the fastest NoSQL database, which offers some of the rich capabilities along with time series data processing in real time.

IQLECT is working with Cisco, Dell and multiple IT infrastructure providers. The SaaS launch will bring much-needed cloud promise to the real-time data analytics to reach out to customers across the world."

1,New breed of BPM consultants emerging,"The business process management (BPM) market is changing with legacy BPM programs being replaced with modern programs designed to unleash the potential of digital business automation.

As a result, process teams are increasingly turning to outside BPM service providers for strategic advice on important decisions.

That's according to Forrester Research's Q4 2016 research into BPM service providers. The report, The Forrester Wave: BPM Service Providers, was authored by Christopher Mines and Clay Richardson.

The authors found that business process leaders increasingly see next generation automation technologies as a way to deal with the different types of challenges facing business including improving customer experience and accelerating digital transformation.

However, the extension of BPM to digital business automation – ""a discipline focused on driving competitiveness through continuous optimisation of business processes across customers' digital touchpoints"" – is a quantum leap for business process leaders.

As adoption of digital process automation grows, organisations are looking for vendors, partners and consultants who can provide capabilities that go beyond traditional BPM to include digital labs, process automation, and user experience (UX) design skills. They are also expected to be able to help process leaders explore and experiment with the new automation technologies without requiring large upfront investments in software or services.

That's because, as the authors point out, some digital automation technologies, such as cognitive computing and the Internet of things, are so new, that business executives often don't recognise their business value. This is then exacerbated by the fact that most process leaders still struggle to scope and deliver cost-effective, small-scale experiments that showcase the full potential of digital business automation. For example, business process leaders are experimenting with autonomous business processes that engage customers and fulfil customer requests with very little human interaction.

The report states that the most difficult part of making the shift to digital automation is not the technology, but rather the new techniques that require a different mindset to that required for traditional BPM approaches.

""The best way to build the design and development skills needed to deliver digital automation is to work alongside a new breed of BPM service providers that already have deep expertise around emerging best practices for digital design and implementation,"" the authors state.

According to the Forrester report, the new breed of BPM consultants no longer place the major emphasis on process modelling, process analysis and process design. Rather, they make considerable use of user experience designers to build better user interfaces that put the user – customer or employee – at the centre of the business process.

They also facilitate experimentation through design studios and labs and merge customer experience and process improvement methodologies.

In short, the new breed of BPM consultants and consulting engagements lower the risk for companies wanting to assess new automation technologies when process leaders are unsure how the technologies will apply to their company's environment, Forrester concludes."
1,"TCS and GE’s Power Services Business High Performance Platform Delivers Crucial Data, 90 Percent Faster than Existing Solutions, Reducing Financial Closure Cycle Time by 20 Percent","SAN FRANCISCO | MUMBAI, September 7, 2017: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), a leading global IT services, consulting and business solutions organization, and GE’s Power Services business (PS), have together completed a complex integration of field service technician information into a Services Data Lake. The platform improves financial process efficiency for power generation asset service operations by integrating disparate data of service work orders and case management from multiple product and service lines including parts, services and repairs.

TCS partnered with GE to deliver Business Data Object Modelling, designed for high performance analytics and reporting.

2,Cloudflare Announces Orbit to Help Fix Challenges in the Internet of Things (IoT) Security Model,"SAN FRANCISCO, April 27, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cloudflare, the leading Internet performance and security company, today announced Orbit, a new approach to securing IoT devices. With Orbit, IoT manufacturers can add an additional layer of security on top of the individual Internet-connected devices via Cloudflare’s high-powered global network, taking IoT security beyond what is possible when relying solely on the security of the device.

In working with IoT manufacturers to develop Orbit, Cloudflare realized the usual device security model, based on the PC approach to user-installed patches, was deeply flawed. There will be 22.5 billion IoT devices in 2021, far outnumbering PCs, and that number will continue to grow. There is no magic bullet that will allow IoT developers to write perfect, bug-free code. And there is no way end users can be expected to upgrade each IoT device the way they needed to with their PCs.

IoT devices need a new security model, and Cloudflare’s Orbit provides a critical component of that new model. With Orbit, IoT manufacturers can configure their devices to only connect to the Internet through Cloudflare’s network. Then, if there is a security vulnerability, the IoT manufacturer can perform a “virtual patch,” across all of their devices, simultaneously. This layer of security complements on-device security and can protect the device even if it is running vulnerable or outdated code.

“The PC-era model of on-device security didn’t work very well for PCs and definitely won’t scale to protect the Internet of Things,” said Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare. “Cloudflare Orbit is already protecting more than 120 million IoT devices and provides a new approach to security that can scale to meet the needs of an increasingly networked world.”

With Orbit, IoT manufacturers can improve device and end-user security with:

Real-Time Exploit Blocking: Utilizing Cloudflare’s firewall in the cloud, Orbit catches exploit attempts, including distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, as they happen, protecting devices that are still running vulnerable code. 

 Secure & Authenticated Data Transfer: Orbit authenticates devices to determine that they actually belong to a user’s network and are not a malicious attacker trying to infiltrate the IoT infrastructure.

 Dedicated Private Network: Orbit locks down the traffic of IoT devices at the network level as if each device has its own VPN, or private network, that secures it from potential attacks.

Consumer IoT Devices Need a Better Solution  

“Keeping our products and customers secure is our primary concern,” said Paul Gerhardt, co-founder of Lockitron. “Cloudflare provides an extra layer of security that allows us to keep our devices continually updated and ahead of any vulnerabilities.” 

Industrial Control Manufacturers Need the Power of a Network

“This approach of adding security to the network is extremely important for industrial manufacturers,” said Sam Cece, CEO of Swift Sensors. “Being able to patch vulnerabilities from the network rather than at the device level is a major shift in the way we secure IoT devices, and one that is completely necessary.”

The Automotive Industry Needs Secure IoT to Keep Passengers and the Road Safer

“Car controllers are IoT devices. Karamba Security hardens these devices and prevents cyberattacks with zero false positives to maintain driver and passenger safety,” said Ami Dotan, CEO of Karamba Security. “We view Cloudflare’s Orbit as a complementary solution that enables secure connectivity between the cars’ hardened controllers and the car company’s data center for trusted, over-the-air updates.”

IoT Platforms Want to Augment their Security 

“We are at the beginning of a new era in which a vast number of devices will be connecting to the Internet and security will play a critical role in the successful roll-out and adoption of IoT devices. Cloudflare’s Orbit adds another layer of defense that compliments other security measures such as strong hardware-based device security and helps ensure a safer Internet of Things."" Quinn Li, VP and global head of Qualcomm Ventures (the investment arm of Qualcomm Incorporated).

Industry Experts Agree with New Security Model 

Michael Freedman, professor of computer science at Princeton University and CTO of Timescale, shared: ""IoT devices create a distinct security challenge both because of the inability of most end users to update their software, as well as the cost that manufacturers bear if they release an update that bricks devices. This is even worse for legacy devices, many of which are effectively unpatchable. Cloudflare's Orbit provides a unique approach to help with these challenges, by deploying a defensive layer in the network where security updates can be safely made without end-user intervention or on-device changes."""

2,Micron and Microsoft Announce Collaboration to Help Improve Internet of Things Security,"Release date- 24042017 - HANNOVER, Germany - Micron Technology (Nasdaq:MU) and Microsoft today announced a collaboration that aims to address the major challenge of providing trusted computing models for IoT deployments in industrial, automotive and consumer environments.

As digitization and adoption of Internet Protocol (IP) for sensors and devices becomes increasingly pervasive, cyber-security is one of the biggest challenges and barriers to the growth of IoT deployments and associated business models. The new solution utilizes a hardware 'root of trust' integrated into Micron's flash memory in the IoT device along with the Microsoft Azure IoT cloud to establish a strong trusted link between that IoT device and the cloud.

At the Hannover Messe 2017, Micron has also announced a new IoT security technology called Micron Authenta that helps enable strong cryptographic device identity and device health management in flash memory. The concept of monitoring persistent memory storage is becoming more and more critical to understanding a device's health. By using Microsoft's support of Device Identity Composition Engine (DICE), an upcoming standard from the Trusted Computing Group (TCG), the combination of the Microsoft Azure IoT cloud and Micron Authenta Technology helps ensure that only trusted hardware gains access to the IoT cloud.

The key aspect of the combined solution is that the health and identity of an IoT device is verified in hardware on the device where critical code is typically stored. This enables more advanced functionality like hardware-based device attestation and provisioning, as well as allows an administrator to securely remediate the device if compromised in the field.

Micron's Authenta Technology provides a unique level of protection for the lowest layers of IoT device software, starting with the boot process. The approach of utilizing existing standard flash memory sockets enables system developers to harden system level security without adding additional hardware components, leading to a more affordable and robust IoT solution. A wide range of IoT devices that use standard flash memory chips can now be enhanced to improve cyber-security using this combined approach.

In addition to the hardware, Microsoft and Micron today announced that they will offer software development kits (SDKs) that help make it easier to provide secure IoT cloud management and connectivity for new platforms and devices, as well as the ability to retrofit legacy systems.

'Microsoft and Micron are collaborating to provide customers with a unified approach to improve IoT security. This capability will speed up adoption of the latest IoT concepts by enabling customers to broaden their IoT connectivity while decreasing the investment of implementation,' said Sam George, director of Azure IoT cloud services. 'Combining these technologies will enable critical security competencies to be underpinned at a low-level in both hardware and software so that users can quickly begin to add their value to these solutions without many of the resource burdens that have been repressing innovation in the industry.'

'A secure Internet of Things requires an always on trust between billions of end-points and cloud management services. Anchors of this trust must be rooted in hardware and be scalable to even the smallest embedded devices,' said Amit Gattani, senior director of Segment Marketing, Embedded Business at Micron. 'We are pleased to see Microsoft extending their Azure IoT platform to include such trust services and creating an ecosystem with partners like Micron that provide hardware root of trust building blocks for end-devices. This will significantly ease developments and deployments for our customers across Industrial, Automotive and Consumer IoT markets.'

Visitors to the Hannover Messe Industrial show this week can come see Azure-connected Micron Authenta Technology Flash solutions in action at the Microsoft booth (C040XX) in Hall 7. And developers can learn how to improve the ROI on IoT implementations by utilizing these solutions at Microsoft Build in SeattleMay 10-12.

Micron's Authenta Technology is initially available in the Serial NOR product family and is sampling now to select customers. Users of Microsoft's DICE technology and Azure IoT services can now contact Micron and Microsoft to begin evaluation and integration of these security and identity solutions.

2,HARMAN and IBM Watson Internet of Things Introduce Cognitive Rooms that Bring Connected Experiences to the Consumer,"ARMONK, N.Y. and NORTHRIDGE, Calif., April 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- HARMAN Professional Solutions and IBM (NYSE: IBM) Watson Internet of Things (IoT) today unveiled Voice-Enabled Cognitive Rooms. Using IBM's Watson artificial intelligence (AI) technology and HARMAN AKG microphones, JBL speakers and AMX AV control and switching systems, the companies bring highly connected experiences to medical facilities, corporate offices, hotels, cruise ships and other hospitality environments.

In addition to the current in-market solutions, HARMAN is part of IBM's cognitive collaboratories based in its $200 million Watson IoT global headquarters in Munich. In this facility today, HARMAN is demonstrating the capabilities of its in-room cognitive concierge in a conference room setting. At the same time the HARMAN team is also working with IBM designers, researchers and others to put IoT into the hands of enterprise customers.

Today IBM's cognitive technologies are embedded into HARMAN soundbars and alarm clocks with other form factors being developed, that users can interact with using natural language. Now consumers can simply ask questions or issue commands with their voice when in a room. These requests are then sent to the Watson cloud and Watson IoT services, which work with HARMAN'S technology to allow people to easily control their in-room subsystems without having to physically perform any manual tasks and trying to figure the new systems out. For example, now when an employee enters a conference room they can start a video conference, launch a presentation and more using their voice. In the future, these tasks will be executed automatically based on what the system has learned about the employee based on previous meetings. The system gets smarter about the person and their preferences over time. 

These capabilities, which are on display at IBM'sMunich office, are being used by customers today in including Thomas Jefferson University Hospital where patients can interact with in-room speakers that are connected to the IBM Watson IoT Platform. As a result, they can enhance their hospital experience by operating lights and window blinds without any manual assistance while asking questions about the hospital facilities or requesting background information on their physician all via natural language.

""We're solving a very distinct problem in hotel, hospital and conference rooms, where people experience unfamiliar environments yet need to perform very simple tasks, such as changing room temperature, adjusting the lighting, opening the blinds, initiating conference calls or launching a presentation,"" said Kevin Morrison, Senior Vice President of Enterprise Solutions for HARMAN Professional Solutions. ""Voice-Enabled Cognitive Rooms by HARMAN make for a natural and intuitive experience, especially for weary travelers or patients with special needs.""

These voice-enabled cognitive rooms also function as an in-room concierge that can answer general questions or site-specific questions developed by the facility and featuring custom answers created by staff. For example, a hotel guest could ask ""What time is checkout? ""or ""Where is the gym?"" while a hospital patient could ask ""What are the hospital's visiting hours?"" or ""Can you tell me more about my doctor?"" Leveraging HARMAN's expertise in API integration, users can even employ Watson for service requests, including amenity replenishments, restaurant reservations, late checkout, room service, shuttle service and more.

""The enterprise and entertainment market possibilities are massive, as IBM and HARMAN seek to connect people more intimately with their environments through cognition and natural language processing,"" said Harriet Green, General Manager, Watson Internet of Things, Customer Engagement and Education, IBM. ""The result of this collaboration is simple, we are leveraging Watson and AI to bring connected environments to a multitude of locations, from hotels to hospitals and offices where they are transforming every day experiences. We look forward to continuing our work with HARMAN by developing new IoT-powered innovations."" 

Leveraging key Watson APIs such as Natural Language Understanding and Speech to Text, these rooms also provide users with limited mobility and vision impairment a closer level of interaction with their environment. Now with Watson, guests can speak naturally to the system without rigid syntax requirements, using simple commands like ""would you turn off the lights?""

Voice-Enabled Cognitive Rooms also feature enterprise-grade software tools that can help in-house technical and guest service staff members increase operational efficiency. For example, housekeeping staff can simply say, ""Send up an engineer to fix the shower"" in their native language. Watson's multilingual capabilities enable organizations to accommodate a wide variety of users from different countries with an ever-growing list of supported languages. 

Like other solutions on the market, the system is activated by a ""wake word."" However, unlike other devices, the wake word for Voice-Enabled Cognitive Rooms by HARMAN is fully customizable. This allows businesses an additional opportunity to brand their experience. In addition to JBL speakers, the system includes AMX NX-1200 Integrated Controller, the AMX Massio™MCP-106 6-Button ControlPad and the AMX Metreau?-Button Ethernet Keypad. 

Availability

Voice-Enabled Cognitive Rooms by HARMAN for enterprise applications will be available in mid-2017."

INRIX, a connected car data analytics specialist, and Citi Logik, a mobile network data analysis firm, have announced a partnership targeting the development of UK smart cities by combining anonymised mobile network data with real-time GPS data and advanced analytics.

The aim, according to INTRIX, is to generate a vast amount of insight on live traffic and pedestrian movements as well as habit analysis and population density. With such insight, INTRIX says transport agencies, local government, city planners and local enterprises will stand to benefit from the potential of working in a smarter city.

INTRIX Chief Revenue Officer Rafay Khan says the necessity for this sort of insight will perpetuate further as urban areas continue densify over the next decade.

Many existing city infrastructures are under strain, designed at times when populations were far smaller. The problem is only intensifying. By 2030, there will be 8.5 billion people in the world with over 60 percent living in urban areas, he said. Our work with Citi Logik will help transport agencies and local govenments in the UK to find new ways of extending and re-engineering cities to cope with a fast growing population and the challenges faced from urbanisation.

Working with INRIX will provide a step change in capability and a one stop shop for movement analytics in the UK, said Stephen Leece, MD of Citi Logik.

Such information is integral to the future success of connected or self-driving cars, it would appear, as INTRIX claims accurate population movement insights are keys for the future transport infrastructure relying on machine-based communications. Combining insights from billions of network data points with GPS data, it says, will help predict future user behaviour and deliver greater revenue opportunities."

2,"IBM, HPE, Cisco and Microsoft drive huge chunk of $6 billion IoT ecosystem","The commercial Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem is exploding and so are the cloud services that go with it, according to new research from TBR.

The 2Q15 Commercial IoT Benchmark analysed how twenty one companies are performing. Through this research, TBR found that the commercial IoT market reached $6 billion in the second quarter of 2016, representing an 18.3% growth year-to-year.

Cloud services have hit 67.2% growth as vendors increase demand for platforms, processing and storage.

The company says that all IoT segments have grown by `double digits`, except for ICT infrastructure. The lack of infrastructure growth only reached 5.3% year-to-year, which was caused by an increasing use of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS).

Fuelling the IoT growth is software, which accounted for 32.5% of total IoT revenue - approximately $1.9 billion in growth.

TBR says that legacy database and application software that still remains on-premise is causing it, with software incumbency still being a large predictor of success in commercial IoT.

TBR says that Microsoft is a key example of this, particularly as its software background is now incumbent as the company cross-sells customers onto Microsoft Azure IoT.

Incumbency proves a foundation for gaining leadership in IoT due to cross-selling, deep relationships and established knowledge. Companies with incumbencies in IT and consulting are the leaders in TBRs benchmark, with IBM, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Cisco and Microsoft emerging as the top four in total IoT revenue at $783.2 million, $593.5 million, $576.2 million and $505.7 million, respectively,"" explains TBR Analyst Dan Callahan.

TBR cites international vendor GE and its digital business, which is also an incumbent. This is because of its software background, however this is also a limitation outside its usual markets. TBR suggests that the company is partnering with other vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle to expand customer bases.

However, TBR also warns that incumbency strategies could also bring `dark horse disruption`. This is because unexpected purchases by vertical companies such as Oracle, Verizon, Bosch or Hewlett Packard could further change the face of how incumbency is consolidated in future."
2,Cisco and Salesforce Team Up for IoT Collaboration,"Ciscos Jasper IoT platform and Salesforces IoT cloud will be integrated.

While much of the hype around IoT has focused on consumer facing products like wearable electronics and sensors that give people information on things like public transport or their energy bills, the study said much of the value will be added in industrial applications in sectors like utilities, manufacturing, automotive and logistics.

The value of the current IoT market was pegged at US$5.6bn by the report shared between roughly 120 organisations. The number of connected devices today was estimated at 200 million, but by 2020 this is expected to grow to 2.7 billion devices.

IoT is set to become a major differentiator in driving the next generation of services and products, Nasscom president R Chandrasekhar told NDTV.

In India, while the industry is at a nascent stage industrial applications of IoT primarily in manufacturing, automotive and transportation and logistics are expected to drive IoT revenues by 2020.

Across the globe, the IoT market is expected to grow to over US$3 trillion during the same period driven by growth in both consumer and industrial applications.

Kevin Ashton, who coined the term Internet of Things to refer to a network of inter-connected devices that can be accessed through the Internet, said solutions were already becoming mainstream in areas like healthcare, automotive and manufacturing.

The ecosystem is rapidly expanding, owing to demand for both Industrial and Consumer IoT applications and is set to be a critical part of the next level of growth for the IT industry, he told Times of India."

Aerialtronics Commercial Drones Give IBM Watson Internet of Things a Bird's Eye View","IBM and Aerialtronics, a Netherlands-based designer and producer of unmanned aircraft systems, today announced the first commercial drones featuring cognitive computing capabilities from the IBM Watson Internet of Things (IoT) Platform on IBM Cloud.  Aerialtronics vehicles can provide high-quality inspection services for global organizations across multiple industries, from monitoring city traffic patterns to inspecting wind turbines, oil rigs and cell tower optimization.

Now, rather than climbing towers, inspecting key areas and reporting back findings, teams can deploy Aerialtronics drones from the ground and, through high definition cameras and Watson Visual Recognition APIs, immediately gain a complete 360-degree, high resolution overview while understanding what it's seeing. Drones can capture these important images in minutes and with the push of a button, immediately send the images to the IBM Watson IoT Platform to be analyzed in near real-time.

Aerialtronics's commercial drones are the first to leverage the IBM Watson IoT Platform and the Visual Recognition APIs to analyze images and identify specific areas of concern such as loose or frayed cabling and damaged equipment that could impact the quality of telecommunications service to consumers. Constantly learning over time, IBM Watson IoT solutions provide a confidence rating to teams so they can determine if and when repairs should be made. As a result, businesses have the potential to significantly increase the number of daily cell tower inspections, reduce possible human error and help maintain the safety of workers.

""Pairing the unlimited perspective of drones with Watson IoT can bring these powerful cognitive capabilities to any location, where it can be used to analyze unexpected traffic patterns resulting from nearby construction or how a train is performing while it's in transit,"" said Harriet Green, General Manager, IBM Watson Internet of Things, Commerce & Education. ""We are very excited to work with Aerialtronics to bring these capabilities to telecommunications providers and we look forward to continuing to push the boundaries on what this pairing can accomplish.""

By putting Watson IoT capabilities into flight, Aerialtronics can help companies open up an expansive number of possibilities to gain insight in places not easily accessible to humans. Possible scenarios include:

Crowd Safety: City Law enforcement could gain a full aerial view of crowds at major events, tracking the flow of individuals and identifying any anomalies that might be cause for concern. For example, if an unusually large group of people gathers near an emergency exit, teams can be alerted to clear these areas for easy accessibility. Damage Assessment: Emergency First Responders could prescribe a specific flight plan for drones, which can then take capture images of their assigned grid. These images could then be analyzed to access potential damage, dangers, and to drive immediate and appropriate emergency response. Aviation Inspection: An aircraft manufacturer could use a drone to inspect the surface of a stationary aircraft as part of its regular maintenance and instance evaluation. The drone could also be programmed to follow the same flight plan of an aircraft, taking images on the fuselage in-flight to provide an even more valuable layer of insight that teams could examine to help identify potential areas of concern and prescribe immediate and appropriate action.

Over time, Aerialtronics' Altura Zenith multirotor will be used to examine other aspects of cell tower performance. Firstly, it will ensure that new towers have a clear line of sight with existing structures and antennas are properly positioned to ensure that customer calls are not dropped as people move from one tower to the next. Drones can also be used to measure the cell size and radio strength in 3D to determine the full range of each tower and which structure should service which location.

""We are excited to be working with IBM to bring these valuable Watson IoT capabilities to businesses across a variety of industries,"" said Jeremy Wigmore, CEO of Aerialtronics. ""By pairing the unmatched perspective of drones with the proven power of Watson IoT solutions, companies can gain actionable insights into anything, anywhere and use this knowledge to help drive important business decisions.""

About Aerialtronics 

Aerialtronics is a manufacturer of unmanned aircraft systems for business and governments worldwide. Based in The Netherlands, Aerialtronics develops and builds multirotor platforms to aviation-grade quality standards, making them reliable, stable, and versatile.

2,NI Partners With IBM and SparkCognition to Advance the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT),"NI, the provider of platform-based systems that enable engineers and scientists to solve the world’s greatest engineering challenges, announced today that SparkCognition is partnering with NI and IBM to collaborate on the Condition Monitoring and Predictive Maintenance Testbed. The goal of the collaboration is to deliver an unprecedented level of interoperability among operational technology and informational technology as organizations search for better methods to manage and extend the life of aging assets in heavy machinery, power generation, process manufacturing and a variety of other industrial sectors.

In a new age of Big Analog Data™ solutions, users can take advantage of machine learning to harness value from information. They can collect raw data and derive insights to improve operations, equipment and processes. Users can also realize huge cost savings and competitive advantages as artificial intelligence-driven prognostics warn of component failures before they occur, identify suboptimal operating conditions and assist with root-cause analysis.

NI’s open, software-centric platform creates the foundation of the Condition Monitoring and Predictive Maintenance Testbed, which delivers on the opportunities present in machine learning. Customers can apply SparkCognition’s cognitive analytics to proactively avoid unplanned equipment fatigue and failure of critical assets thus enhancing system capabilities by gaining advanced insights into equipment health and remediation solutions. These capabilities help increase operational efficiencies and safety, and decrease maintenance costs.

“With IIoT technologies driving vast sensorization of industrial equipment, and massive amounts of data being collected on those assets, the collaboration between NI and SparkCognition powers the complex and intelligent processing of information to produce valuable insights,” said Stuart Gillen, director of business development at SparkCognition.

“We are excited that our platform can acquire the data and extract the features to drive SparkCognition analytics for IIoT solutions,” said Jamie Smith, director of embedded systems at NI. “Combined with existing technologies in the testbed, the addition of SparkCognition presents new ways to help automate the process of turning sensor data into business insight.”

With this software-defined approach, viewing, managing and refining a broad range of assets stands in direct contrast to the traditional, fixed-functionality methods of the past, which often take too much time, rely on hard-to-find talent and require custom model building for each type of asset."

Both manufacturers and consumers seem unwilling to bear the cost of stronger security measures for connected devices they either see as nearly disposable or not worth upgrading.

“The government has to get involved. This is a market failure,” security technologist Bruce Schneier told the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Nov. 16.  

» Get the best federal technology news and ideas delivered right to your inbox. Sign up here.

To keep costs low, many IoT manufacturers don't invest in the kind of security features and protocols consumers expect from computer and smartphone makers. They often skip good cyber hygiene practices, too. Some devices feature default or easily identifiable passwords or hard-coded credentials users can’t change, and others require consumers to watch out for security updates, Level 3 Communications Chief Security Officer Dale Drew said in written testimony.

Insecure devices infected by Mirai malware overwhelmed web services provider Dyn in October, knocking popular websites like Netflix and Twitter offline for hours. They were only a fraction of the botnet—one likely rented by an individual with a personal grudge against a gaming site, Drew wrote.

Botnet operators, motivated by money or mischief, will continue recruiting IoT devices because they have little to no security and can go undetected for a long time. Security standards or certifications from the government could help, Drew said.

Alternately, the government could incentivize the industry to build security into products and encourage cryptography, said Dr. Kevin Fu, Virta Labs CEO and University of Michigan engineering and computer science associate professor. His suggestion is in line with the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s recent Systems Security Engineering guidance.  

At the beginning of the hearing, Chairman Greg Walden, R.-Ore., said he was open to some kind of regulation though the experts didn’t agree on how to go about it. Lawmakers asked if the government could come up with one set of IoT standards to secure all types of devices, and while Drew thought it could, Fu and Schneier disagreed. They also discussed breaking regulation down by agency, though several agencies including the Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission and National Highway Traffic Security Administration already issue guidance over some aspects of the internet of things.

Schneier suggested a new, centralized agency. Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., said it was the wrong climate for that, though Walden and Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Texas, said they were open to the idea if they could eliminate two existing agencies.

“Nothing motivates the government into action like security and fear,” Schneier said, citing how the Homeland Security Department was created in 44 days."
2,Internet of Things: Telecoms now have a foundation of what digital transformation bringsand the police say,"Internet of Things: Telecoms now have a foundation of what digital transformation brings The network of all networks the Internet developed a long time ago so much that it offers unconceivable possibilities for people. One of them is the Internet of Things IoT, a concept that enables the networking of various things and objects from everyday life and their internet communication, without human interaction, all in order to improve the conditions and way of life. Alen Gojceta, head of Vipnet's ICT sale to users explains that every object connectible through IoT should contain an assembly for management, sensors, a battery and some form of a communication device that enable the exchange of data and control orders. Such complexity is the reason for the relatively high price of the IoT sensors. Gojceta says that the traditional ICT was more in its own centre, while its interaction with the surroundings is now more placed in the centre. In the next few years, Vipnet will become an unavoidable partner in creating fast and robust solutions that unite data processing, sensor management, digital transactions and telecommunication services combined with data centre services, as Gojceta says."

According to the…
2,"Internet of Things Spending Forecast to Grow 17.9% in 2016 Led by Manufacturing, Transportation, and Utilities Investments, According to New IDC Spending Guide","FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Worldwide spending on the Internet of Things (IoT) is forecast to reach $737 billion in 2016 as organizations invest in the hardware, software, services, and connectivity that enable the IoT. According to a new update to the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Semiannual Internet of Things Spending Guide, global IoT spending will experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.6% over the 2015-2020 forecast period, reaching $1.29 trillion in 2020. 

The industries forecast to make the largest IoT investments in 2016 are Manufacturing ($178 billion), Transportation ($78 billion), and Utilities ($69 billion). Consumer IoT purchases, the fourth largest market segment in 2016, will become the third largest segment by 2020. Meanwhile, Cross-Industry IoT investments, which represent use cases common to all industries, such as connected vehicles and smart buildings, will rank among the top segments throughout the five-year forecast. The industries that will see the fastest spending growth are Insurance, Consumer, Healthcare, and Retail. 

Given Manufacturing's position as the leading IoT industry, it's no surprise that manufacturing operations is the IoT use case that will see the largest investment ($102.5 billion) in 2016. Other IoT use cases being deployed in Manufacturing include production asset management and maintenance and field service. The second largest use case, Freight Monitoring ($55.9 billion), will drive much of the IoT spending in the Transportation industry. In the Utilities industry, combined investments in Smart Grid for electricity and gas will total $57.8 billion in 2016. Smart Home investments by consumers will more than double over the forecast period, reaching more than $63 billion by 2020. In the Insurance industry, telematics will be the leading use case while remote health monitoring will see the greatest investment in the Healthcare industry. Retail firms are already investing in a variety of use cases, including omni-channel operations and digital signage. 

""A fairly close relationship exists between high growth IoT use cases in consumer product and service oriented verticals like retail, insurance, and healthcare,"" said Marcus Torchia, research manager, IoT, with IDC's Customer Insights and Analysis team. ""In some cases, these are green field opportunities with tremendous room to run. In other verticals, like manufacturing and transportation, large market size and more moderate growth rate use cases characterize these verticals. As a whole, the IoT opportunity is a diverse developing market place for vendors and end users alike."" 

From a technology perspective, hardware will remain the largest spending category throughout the forecast, followed by services, software, and connectivity. And while hardware spending will nearly double over the five-year timeframe, it represents the slowest growing IoT technology group. Software and services spending will both grow faster than hardware and connectivity. Hardware spending will approach $400 billion by 2020. Modules and sensors, that connect end points to networks, will dominate hardware purchases, while application software will represent more than half of all IoT software investments. 

Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan)(APeJ) is the geographic region that will see the greatest IoT spending throughout the forecast, followed by the United States, Western Europe, and Japan. Nearly a third of IoT purchases in APeJ will be made by the manufacturing industry, while Utilities and Transportation will change places as the second and third largest IoT industries by the end of the forecast. In the United States, Manufacturing will be the industry with the largest IoT investments throughout the forecast but with a lower share (roughly 15%) of total spending. In Western Europe, Consumer IoT spending will overtake Transportation and Utilities to become the second largest IoT industry in 2020. 

""It is great to see that the Internet of Things will continue to fuel both business transformation and innovation acceleration markets such as robotics, cognitive computing, and virtual reality,"" said IoT Research Fellow and Senior Vice President Vernon Turner. ""The investments by China and the United States in IoT solutions is driving these two countries to account for double-digit annual growth rates and over half of the IoT spending."" 

An IDC Web conference reviewing the Worldwide IoT Spending Guide will be held on January 11, 2017 at 11:00 amU.S. Eastern time. Details and registration for this complimentary event can be found at http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=IDC_P35508. 

The Worldwide Semiannual Internet of Things Spending Guideforecasts IoT spending for 12 technologies and 49 use cases across 20 vertical industries in eight regions and 52 countries. Unlike any other research in the industry, the comprehensive spending guide was designed to help vendors clearly understand the industry-specific opportunity for IoT technologies today.

2,T-Mobile Delivers Simplicity to the Internet of Things,"The Un-carrier’s new IoT Access packs come with Cat1 modules and wireless data to simplify and accelerate IoT development

Since the launch of Un-carrier™, T-Mobile’s tackled and solved some of the worst pain points for consumers and businesses, and now, the Un-carrier’s bringing the same approach to the “Internet of Things” (IoT). Today, T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS) unveiled two new simple, straightforward, low-cost IoT Access packs with wireless data – and a Category 1 (Cat1) module on us – to help accelerate IoT innovation and eliminate the pain of piecing together wireless IoT solutions. 

“Like everything they do, the carriers over-complicate the Internet of Things, and that leads to more hassle and cost for customers,” said Doug Chartier, Senior Vice President, T-Mobile. “The wireless industry needs simpler options for IoT to take off, and that’s exactly what we’re delivering.” 

In today’s market, if a device maker wants to create an IoT solution, they must buy a wireless module from one vendor then negotiate to purchase an overpriced data plan from a carrier – all before bringing their solution to market. That doesn’t encourage IoT development. It only helps line the carriers’ pockets, while stifling innovation and slowing time to market. 

With T-Mobile’s IoT Access packs, new and existing customers can get everything they need – including modules and data – to develop the next great IoT solution. For applications that use a little data, customers can get up to 5MB of data per month for $20 per year per device in the first year and just $6 per year per device afterwards. For unlimited data at 64kbps, it’s just $25 per year per device, and for a limited time, these customers get $5 off the first year for each device. With both T-Mobile IoT Access packs, T-Mobile will cover the cost of a Sequans Cat1 module, via a bill credit from T-Mobile, up to $16 per module. 

In addition, T-Mobile today announced plans to continue to help customers deliver the next-generation of devices for machine-to-machine communications. T-Mobile is continuing to work to deliver “Category M” and “Narrowband IoT” (NB-IoT), the next evolution of modules to help customers save money over time and take advantage of T-Mobile’s expanding LTE coverage, based on market and customer needs. Combined with the Cat1 modules available on T-Mobile’s 4G LTE network today, these future modules will provide another technology option to give customers choice in improved data speeds and a longer product lifecycle compared to 2G network technologies. 

T-Mobile has already tackled some of the biggest obstacles slowing IoT innovation with solutions for IoT and machine-to-machine (M2M) solutions. In 2016, T-Mobile provided customers ways to future-proof their IoT solutions on today’s LTE networks with support for Category 1 modules; extended 2G network operations to support customer transitions to LTE through 2020; was first to open the door for wireless development at the platform level with Twilio; delivered wireless solutions for retail businesses with ignite by Inseego; and, most recently launched T-Mobile SyncUP DRIVE, a new all-in-one connected car solution. 

For more information on T-Mobile’s IoT solutions, visit: http://iot.t-mobile.com. 

Limited time offer, subject to change. While supplies last. Plus taxes and fees. Contact your T-Mobile rep for additional details and contract requirements. Redemption required for bill credit, may take 1-2 bill cycles. On all T-Mobile plans, during congestion the top 3% of data users (>28 GB/mo.) may notice reduced speeds until next bill cycle due to data prioritization. 

About T-Mobile US, Inc.

As America's Un-carrier, T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMUS) is redefining the way consumers and businesses buy wireless services through leading product and service innovation. The Company's advanced nationwide 4G LTE network delivers outstanding wireless experiences to approximately 69.4 million customers who are unwilling to compromise on quality and value.

3,How P&G and American Express Are Approaching AI,"There is a tendency with any new technology to believe that it requires new management approaches, new organizational structures, and entirely new personnel. That impression is widespread with cognitive technologies — which comprises a range of approaches in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and deep learning. Some have argued for the creation of “chief cognitive officer” roles, and certainly many firms are rushing to hire experts with deep learning expertise. “New and different” is the ethos of the day.

But we believe that successful firms can treat cognitive technologies as an opportunity to evolve or grow from previous work. For firms that have been producing results with big data analytics, machine learning isn’t too much of a stretch. If firms had previous experience with expert systems, they are familiar with some of the necessary organizational and process changes arising from contemporary cognitive tools. These firms are likely to have already established the organizational structures needed to nurture and spread new technologies and business approaches. And they have well-honed approaches for developing the requisite new skills in employees...(https://hbr.org/2017/03/how-pg-and-american-express-are-approaching-ai)"
3,New photopatternable polyimide and programmable nonvolatile memory performances,"Authors report the first photopatternable, nonvolatile memory consisting of high-temperature polyimide (PI), poly(hexafluoroisopropylidenediphthalimide-4-cinnamoyloxytri-phenylamine) (6F-HTPA-CI), and we demonstrate the successful fabrication and programmable operation of ‘write-read-erase’ memory devices based on nanoscale thin films of 6F-HTPA-CI. The PI thin film enables scalable fine patternability, providing lines and spaces with excellent pattern fidelity. Isolated individual memory devices were successfully fabricated on a bottom electrode via a sequential process of coating, photopatterning, top electrode deposition, developing, rinsing and drying. The 6F-HTPA-CI cells exhibited excellent nonvolatile memory performances in three different modes (unipolar permanent, unipolar flash and bipolar flash memories), regardless of photo-exposure doses.

3,"Spooky quantum computing the new frontier for banking, but it has its risks","Commonwealth Bank’s announcement that it has developed a quantum computer simulator takes the bank a step closer to its ambition of building a small, 10-qubit (quantum bits) machine by 2020.

From there, it would rapidly scale up, with the user cases expanding well beyond current understanding.

The idea behind the simulator is that it’s better to start thinking in a quantum way and developing applications across a variety of industries than waiting for the hardware to become available.

Applications for a large, complex bank like CBA start with so-called Monte Carlo simulations, where the impact of risk is assessed on the full range of scenarios under consideration.

Under classical computing, it takes about a day to work out the risk position of the bank.

Quantum computing would deliver the same outcome in a matter of minutes, enabling more dynamic decision-making as a result of real-time data feeds.

Trading positions could be known in real time, with investment strategies chosen after consideration of millions of different scenarios. Beyond such base-level applications, the potential is mostly unknown because problem-solving in business is constrained by the limits of classical computing.

The core advantage of quantum computing is that information can be stored in a large number of different states at the same time.

Classical computers store information as bits that represent either a “1” or a “0”.

However, relying on the effects of quantum physics, qubits in a computer could be “1” or “0”, or “1” and “0” at the same time.

It’s not all upside, though — quantum computing could also pose risks to the security of customer data and the stability of the financial services industry.

To gain access to customer data, a hacker currently has to use trial and error to crack a code that could be hundreds of digits long.

Quantum computers could perform the same task much more efficiently, and at much greater risk to the customer.

Don’t interfere The usual market stabilisers have kicked in for the east coast apartment market, so one of the big risks right now is not so much an oversupply as the potential for unintended consequences from policies designed to fix an old problem.

?Over the last year or so, there’s been a lot of talk about an apartment glut in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne and the danger it poses to bank balance sheets and even financial stability.

The Reserve Bank warned in October last year about the “marked” pick-up in apartment construction in recent years, with inner-city Melbourne forecast to have the largest number of completions (about 16,000) over a two-year horizon, followed by Brisbane (12,000) and Sydney (10,000).

About 2-5 per cent of total bank mortgage lending is to inner-city areas in the three capitals, which is likely to grow as the apartments currently under construction are completed.

Mortgage exposures in Sydney are thought to be worth about $20 billion-$30bn, reflecting the volume of apartments and higher prices, compared to $10bn-$20bn in each of Brisbane and Melbourne.

As for development exposures, they come in at less than $5bn for each of Melbourne and Brisbane, with Sydney less again because it has less activity.

Risk is higher in Brisbane and Melbourne because the new apartments represent a far larger increase in the dwelling stock, exacerbated by relatively subdued apartment-price and rental growth in the same two cities.

Housing market conditions are therefore more vulnerable to the addition of more stock.

The high level of focus on the apartment market reflects its “lumpy” supply characteristics and the heavy involvement of investors.

Warnings about a chronic, emerging oversupply began in 2011 and have only intensified.

The logic is compelling if you only look at the supply side of the equation and assume nothing else has changed — a fundamental flaw in the fearmongering over oversupply, according to independent property analysts Charter Keck Cramer.

National research director Scott Papaleo says the previous peak for Melbourne’s apartment completions was 6000 in 2005, when the city’s annual population growth was 60,000.

While completions rocketed to 19,000 in 2016, population growth almost doubled to 120,000.

There’s also been a seachange in acceptance of high-density, inner-city living close to the central business district where most of the higher-paying jobs are located.

Says Papaleo: “There’s been an unprecedented level of supply but it’s been matched by unprecedented levels of demand, which does not suggest an oversupply.” The market’s automatic stabilisers have also kicked in.

East coast project launches have fallen by 25-30 per cent since the beginning of last year, with actual project commencements stable in Sydney but considerably lower in Brisbane and Melbourne.

Papaleo questions weekend reports that more than half the apartments bought off the plan in Melbourne’s CBD, Docklands and Southbank since 2011 have changed hands at a loss, saying this doesn’t factor in stamp duty benefits and wear and tear.

The risk of oversupply in Melbourne is actually dissipating."

3,New research into light particles challenges understanding of quantum theory,"By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at VerticalNews Science -- Scientists have discovered a new mechanism involved in the creation of paired light particles, which could have significant impact on the study of quantum physics.

Researchers at the University of East Anglia (UEA) have shown that when photons - the fundamental particles of light - are created in pairs, they can emerge from different, rather than the same, location.

The ground-breaking research could have significant implications for quantum physics, the theoretical basis of modern physics. Until now, the general assumption was that such photon pairs necessarily originate from single points in space.

Quantum entanglement - when particles are linked so closely that what affects one directly affects the other - is widely used in labs in numerous processes from quantum cryptography to quantum teleportation.

The UEA team were studying a process called spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), in which photon beams are passed through a crystal to generate entangled pairs of photons.

Prof David Andrews in UEA's School of Chemistry said: ""When the emergent pairs equally share the energy of the input, this is known as degenerate down-conversion, or DDC.

""Until now, it has been assumed that such paired photons come from the same location. Now, the identification of a new delocalized mechanism shows that each photon pair can be emitted from spatially separated points, introducing a new positional uncertainty of a fundamental quantum origin.""

The entanglement of the quantum states in each pair has important applications in quantum computing - theoretical computation systems that could potentially process big data problems at incredible speeds - as well as other areas of quantum physics.

The findings are also significant because they place limits on spatial resolution. Prof Andrews said: ""Everything has a certain quantum 'fuzziness' to it, and photons are not the hard little bullets of light that are popularly imagined.""

The study 'Nonlocalized generation of correlated photon pairs in degenerate down-conversion' by Kayn A. Forbes, Jack S. Ford, and David L. Andrews is published in the journal Physical Review Letters."
3,Quantum Computing and the Generalized Knapsack Code,"A mathematical paper clarifying the use of number in computing and cryptography has been recently released which has implications for quantum computing.

PULLMAN, WA, UNITED STATES, April 5, 2017 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Many intelligent people believe that quantum computing as a reality on this planet is within our near future. The field of cryptography is somewhat unique in that probably relatively few people know what is going on in the field as a whole at any given time. That said, the primary codes that are thought to be widely in use for commerce today (wire transfers, internet transactions) are known to be insecure in the presence of a quantum computer.

 Quantum computers are not only much faster than conventional computers, but they are capable of running special algorithms or processes that a conventional computer cannot. One of these, Shor’s algorithm, is known to be effective against RSA, codes based on the discrete logarithm, and elliptic curve cryptography.

 A knapsack code is code based on an old math problem called the knapsack problem. The knapsack problem involved a set of physical objects of different weights, some of which were placed in a knapsack. To solve the problem, someone had to figure out which weights had been used merely from knowing the possible original weights and the weight of the knapsack. 

 The original knapsack code, which was one of the first public-key or asymmetrical cryptosystems proposed, was vulnerable to some important attacks which presupposed the numbers used were being represented in binary, which is in many ways a very reasonable assumption in the context of conventional computing at least. 

 The publicly available research that has been done so far would seem to indicate that a secure, lattice-based code would not be vulnerable to attacks by a quantum computer, perhaps because it is not possible to design algorithms that could run on quantum or conventional computers to defeat them. 

 Lattice-based codes, put as simply as possible, are codes where the solution is a vector in a lattice. A simple example of a lattice is the Cartesian plane we learn to graph lines on in algebra in school.

 The generalized knapsack code is one such lattice-based code, and it differs from the original knapsack code in that it relies on many other representations than binary. It is the multiple forms of representation that I believe make it a secure code, though I also believe these matters need to be primarily settled on the basis of physical testing.

 As to the other types of non-binary representations, I can give an analogy. You can think of binary as black and white, and base 10 as a palette of 10 colors that can only be used in a very specific way. The other representations may contain any number of colors, with each representation having its own more or less unique way of using the colors. One of the more well-known alternate representations is the Zeckendorf representation, which makes use of the Fibonacci sequence.

 The difference between the GKC and the original one is in the approach to the knapsack code used. In the original code, you either used a weight or you didn't, and each choice was relatively independent from the others, except with regard to the size of the knapsack. In the generalized knapsack code, you might use more than one weight of the same size, and you might choose a group of weights linked together rather than just a single one.

 My newest paper, which can be found online in the Open Journal of Discrete Mathematics (http://www.scirp.org/Journal/PaperInformation.aspx?PaperID=73743), Number in Mathematical Cryptography, is primarily aimed at helping the scholarly community, and perhaps the business community, understand why the generalized knapsack is likely to be a good option for post-quantum public-key cryptography. A secondary aim is to provide a context in which people from different disciplines can meaningfully discuss some of the deeper issues surrounding number that perhaps have been somewhat compartmentalized in our recent history. I use the word ""number"" here because one of the reasons my paper was needed is that ""number"" is very difficult to define, and different people are using slightly different definitions. Here I am concerned primarily with the natural numbers: 1,2,3,4,5,6, etc.

 Physicists, engineers, pure and applied mathematicians, and perhaps even philosophers make use of number in their work, and in some respects quantum computing intersects with each of their fields. 

 This latter concern is for me not a merely academic issue, as in my experience many specialists have certain relatively minor assumptions about numbers which perhaps work rather well within their fields, but do not transfer very well to other related fields. Public-key cryptography was a child of pure mathematics, but engineers, computers scientists and perhaps others as well are very heavily involved in its implementation and maintenance. In my understanding, both quantum computing and the generalized knapsack code require an unusual amount of clarity on these matters, and I am hoping to at least get the discussion going, but I also hope that I have effectively pointed the way as to how these issues might be resolved.

 A code like the generalized knapsack code, which could be implemented on both conventional and quantum computers, would in many ways be ideal for navigating the transition to quantum computing as it would require a relative minor change in hardware, if not in software as well."

3,Brains and computers: We can remember it for you wholesale,"Elon Musk enters the world of brain-computer interfaces

EVER since ENIAC, the first computer that could be operated by a single person, began flashing its ring counters in 1946, human beings and calculating machines have been on a steady march towards tighter integration. Computers entered homes in the 1980s, then migrated onto laps, into pockets and around wrists. In the laboratory, computation has found its way onto molars and into eyeballs. The logical conclusion of all this is that computers will, one day, enter the brain.

This, at least, is the bet behind a company called Neuralink, just started by Elon Musk, a serial technological entrepreneur. Information about Neuralink is sparse, but trademark filings state that it will make invasive devices for treating or diagnosing neurological ailments. Mr Musk clearly has bigger plans, though. He has often tweeted cryptic messages referring to ""neural lace"", a science-fictional concept invented by Iain M. Banks, a novelist, that is, in essence, a machine interface woven into the brain.

Although devices that can read and write data to and from the brain as easily as they would to and from a computer remain firmly in the realm of imagination, that has not stopped neuroscientists (and, of course, Mr Musk) from indulging in some speculation. Theodore Berger of the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles, has proposed that brain implants might be used to store and retrieve memories. Dr Berger's prosthesis would be intended to help those whose brains cannot form long-term memories because they are damaged. But if the idea worked, there seems little reason why those without damage should not and would not want something similar. Mr Musk himself, more ambitiously still, imagines an implant that would let the wearer tap directly into the internet, and all of the computational power available there.

Of minds and melding

Behind this suggestion lies Mr Musk's argument, made repeatedly, that human beings need to embrace brain implants to stay relevant in a world which, he believes, will soon be dominated by artificial intelligence. Proposing the artificial augmentation of human intelligence as a response to a boom in artificial intelligence may seem a bit much. But Mr Musk's new company is not alone. A firm called Kernel is following a similar path.

To start with, Kernel's engineers hope to build devices for the treatment of neurological conditions such as strokes and Alzheimer's disease. Ultimately, however, they want to create cognition-enhancing implants that anyone might care to buy. Kernel was founded in October 2016 by Bryan Johnson, an entrepreneur who, like Mr Musk, got rich by processing payments online (PayPal, which Mr Musk helped found, bought Braintree, Mr Johnson's company, in 2013). Mr Johnson put $100m of his own money into Kernel, stating that ""unlocking our brain is the most significant and consequential opportunity in history.""

In some ways, Mr Johnson and Mr Musk are merely the new boys in what is quite an old field. The first brain implants, carried out in the 1970s, were prosthetic visual systems, though they did not work well. Cochlear implants, to restore hearing, have done much better. Hundreds of thousands of people now have them--though, strictly speaking, they talk to auditory nerves rather than to the brain directly, which simplifies the task. For some people, the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can be kept in check by electrodes the diameter of a strand of spaghetti inserted deep into the brain. And one of the latest ideas in the field is to read and interpret brain activity, in order to restore movement to the limbs of the paralysed (see ""Biomedical engineering: Moving moments"").

In one important way, however, Kernel and Neuralink are different from previous efforts. Though aimed initially at medical applications, they also explicitly nod to the possible non-medical uses of this kind of implant technology. In February Mr Musk said that he thought ""meaningful"" interfaces between the brain and computation were five years away. The creation of Neuralink suggests that he, like Mr Johnson, is putting his money where his mouth is.

Most neuroscientists would, it must be acknowledged, regard all this as heroically optimistic. In a review of the field, published in January in Nature Reviews Materials, Polina Anikeeva and her colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) wrote that, although Moore's Law and the miniaturisation of electronics have brought devices down to a size where their insertion into the brain can be considered, big challenges lie ahead.

The brain's complexity, and researchers' present lack of understanding of how that organ's component cells work together to do what they do, makes designing interfaces between brain and machine hard. But, even were it simple in principle, the rigid, silicon-based tools of modern computing do not mesh easily with the squishy soft-tissue of biology. Implants often generate scars around themselves. And the surgery needed to put them in place carries risks of its own.

There may, though, be alternative approaches. One such is being tested by a group at Florida International University, in Miami, led by Sakhrat Khizroev. Dr Khizroev and his team use magnetoelectric particles so tiny that they can interact with the electric field generated by an individual nerve cell. The team inject these particles, tens of billions at a time, into a vein in a rat's tail, then drag them into the animal's brain using magnets. Each particle produces an electric field when stimulated by an external magnetic field. This may, in principle, permit a researcher to use such a particle to influence the electrical states of nearby nerve cells--and thus, in essence, reprogram them. How that would be done in practice, though, is obscure.

Another approach, being pioneered by Jose Carmena of the University of California, Berkeley, and his colleagues, uses devices the size of a grain of rice to convert ultrasonic energy beamed towards them into electricity that can stimulate nerve or muscle cells. Ultrasound travels through the body, so can power and control such devices without wires.

Both Dr Khizroev's technique and Dr Carmena's are less invasive than the current standard brain interface, a patch of needlelike electrodes known as a Utah array that is plugged into the brain's surface. This is far too blunt an instrument to send any but the crudest signals into a brain. But, regardless of the precise approach taken to hardware, another problem the field faces is that no one understands the mechanism behind the natural equivalent of software--the way the brain encodes information. Such interfaces as do exist have to be trained, rather than instructed what to do. Instruction would be possible only if brain signals were properly understood.

It is not yet clear which technological routes Mr Musk's and Mr Johnson's commercial efforts will take, though Kernel recently bought Kendall Research Systems, a spin-off from MIT that builds devices which use light, rather than electricity, to stimulate the brain. But the two firms' shared underlying premise--that medical purposes might lead to more consumer-orientated applications--does seem a sensible way to do things.

People understand that medical procedures can be risky. As long as it is done in good faith, they will tolerate experimentation on people that would be intolerable in non-medical circumstances. That will let Neuralink, Kernel and those that come along afterwards build up expertise that might be turned to more general effect in the future.

As for Mr Musk himself, Neuralink brings to five the number of ambitious technology companies in which he is involved. The others are Tesla (electric cars, batteries and solar power), which this week attracted an investment from Tencent, a Chinese tech giant; SpaceX (rocketry); the Boring Company (tunnelling); and Hyperloop (vacuum trains). It is hard to discern the connections between these ideas. But, in Mr Musk's mind, they are presumably already laced together."
3,Brain implant lets paralyzed man feed himself using his thoughts,"CHICAGO - A paralyzed man in Cleveland fed himself mashed potatoes for the first time in eight years, aided by a computer-brain interface that reads his thoughts and sends signals to move muscles in his arm, US researchers said on Tuesday.

The research, published in the journal Lancet, is the latest from BrainGate, a consortium of researchers testing brain-computer interface technology designed to give paralyzed individuals more mobility. Prior tests of the technology allowed paralyzed people to move a robotic arm or a cursor on a keyboard just by using their thoughts.

The team used the brain-computer interface and an electrical stimulation system that allowed Bill Kochevar, 56, to control his own arm.

To achieve this, the team implanted two sensors, each about the size of a baby aspirin, loaded with 96 electrodes designed to pick up nerve activity in the movement centers of the brain.

The sensors record brain signals created when Kochevar imagines moving his arm, and relay them to a computer. The computer sends the signals to the electrical stimulation system, which directs impulses through about 30 wires implanted in muscles in Kochevar's arm and hand to produce specific movements.

Kochevar, who was paralyzed below his shoulders in a cycling accident eight years ago, first learned to use the system to move a virtual reality arm on a computer screen. He accomplished that on the first day he tried it, said Case Western's Robert Kirsch, the study's senior author.

For the movement phase of the trial, Kochevar had to go through 45 weeks of rehabilitation to restore muscle tone that had atrophied over the years of inactivity.

Using the brain interface system, he can now move each joint in his right arm individually, just by thinking about it. To accomplish tasks like drinking through a straw, or scratching his face with a dry sponge, Kochevar is aided by an arm support, a device he also controls with his thoughts.

Kochevar said the chance to do simple things for himself has been ""better than I thought it would be"".

For the moment, the system is experimental only, but the study shows such a system is feasible, Kirsch said.

3,IBM launches blockchain-based pharma logistics services in China,"One of the oldest computer giants, IBM, is in the logistics news again after launching a blockchain-based financial services platform for pharmaceutical procurement that the company says will increase efficiency, transparency and operation of supply-chain finance.Blockchain

Blockchain technology has the potential to reduce transaction costs, eliminate redundancies and increase visibility in supply chains, especially in airfreight, were many companies still use paper to record shipments and transactions.

Big Blue developed the platform in conjunction with Hejia, a Chinese supply chain firm and an initial pharmaceutical retailer, a hospital and a bank. Hejia plans to expand the platform to include multiple pharmaceutical retailers, hospitals and banks later this year.

Shen Xiaowei, director of IBM research in China, explained that, blockchain can fundamentally transform businesses by eliminating inefficiencies, speeding up transactions and enabling innovative new business models.

Chinas underdeveloped credit evaluation and risk control systems make it hard for small- and medium-sized retailers to raise funds. In practice, this means that pharmaceutical retailers often wait up to 90 days to recover payment after delivering medicine to hospitals.

Without sound credit records and collateral to meet financing standards, these retailers often find it difficult to get loans from traditional financial institutions. Blockchain, however, circumvents this logjam by making transactions secure, verifiable and instantaneous.

3,IBM names blockchain adoption principles,"Dive Brief:

IBM this week shared three key principles business leaders should consider when adopting blockchain technology.

One: blockchain creates a smart, tamper-resistant means of conducting trade and business processes. Two: blockchain brings more value as its network grows. Three: blockchain can cut deal times from days or weeks to seconds by improving visibility and trust across participants.

Last month, IBM launched what it called the first enterprise-ready blockchain service, which allows developers to build and host secure blockchain networks on the companys cloud. The tool is designed to scale up as new network members join.

Dive Insight:

The healthcare industry is rapidly embracing the idea blockchain. A recent report by Deloitte found 35% of surveyed healthcare and life sciences organizations plan to deploy blockchain technology this year, outpacing all other industries. Last December, blockchain along with artificial intelligence, drones and 3-D printing were flagged as emerging tech ospital administratrors should become familiar with this year, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers` Health Research Institute.

In a LinkedIn post last summer, Humana CEO Bruce Broussard predicted that blockchains ability to enable secure and trackable transactions between multiple partners without need for an intermediary could revolutionize healthcare.

To encourage use of blockchain, the Office of National Coordinator for Health IT launched a challenge to use the technology to solve privacy, security and scalability issues in EMRs. The 15 winners, which included Accenture and Mayo Clinic, received cash awards ranging from $1,500 to $5,000"

3,Dubai ‘could become first Blockchain powered city’,"Dubai is rapidly moving toward implementing Blockchain technology, which offers speedy and cost-effective transactions, and reaching its target of becoming the first Blockchain powered city by 2020, a senior IT expert has said.

Saeed Al Dhaheri, chairman, Smartworld, while addressing a gathering of decision-makers and experts from across the UAE's IT sector, said: ""The market size for Blockchain is projected to grow from $210 million in 2016 to over $2.3 billion by 2021 and more organisations are looking for consultants to understand the applicability and impact of Blockchain in their businesses.""

Highlighting the government initiatives in the direction, Dhaheri said the Dubai Blockchain Strategy will usher in tremendous economic opportunity across all sectors and further enhance Dubai's reputation as a global technology leader, in line with Smart Dubai's mandate to become global leader in the smart economy.

Launched by His Highness Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of Dubai Executive Council, the Dubai Blockchain Strategy is a result of a collaboration between the Smart Dubai Office and the Dubai Future Foundation to continually explore and evaluate the latest technology innovations that demonstrate an opportunity to deliver more seamless, safe, efficient, and impactful city experiences. Adoption of Blockchain is estimated to result in over Dh5.5 billion savings annually towards document processing alone.

""No one can ignore the importance of Blockchain and bitcoin at this moment as it's gaining momentum,"" said Dhaheri. ""It's important for all industries including healthcare, real estate, insurance and others, and we are about to see a lot of adoption in the next 5-10 years,"" he added.

Talking about the challenges in implementation, Dhaheri said confusion in proper understanding of this technology, lack of trained resources and technical challenges need to be dealt with for effective implementation and to reap the most of Blockchain.

""Having in-depth knowledge toward the Blockchain technology is a must. Blockchain is a collection of pre-existing technologies, in an elegant way. There are many options to choose from when building a tailor-fit platform or a service according to specific needs of the business but choosing options and building successful business heavily depend on the knowledge or experience the implementer has on technology,"" he added.

Dhaheri also highlighted on the need for regulators and market participants to proactively work together to identify the best supervisory models and approaches. - TradeArabia News Service"

3,Microsoft Harnesses Machine Learning for Sourcing,"The only way that we can serve our travelers is by turning them into data,"" travel management provocateur Eric Bailey told BTN. Bailey is better known as Microsoft`s director of travel, venue sourcing and payment. He has pretty much ditched travel policy for Microsoft`s 75,000 travelers in exchange for a traveler-centric approach. Machine learning has emerged as critical to the effort. ""We can`t know all of our travelers,"" he said. ""What we can do is take their data and turn it back into travelersor at least types of travelers. That`s how we`re using machine learning now.""

Microsoft travel manager for compliance and analytics Marta Rodriguez explained more: ""Machine learning allows us to cluster travelers and build persona types based on behavioral features: bookings, expenses, history, everything we know."" That gives the Microsoft travel team a solid foundation for setting up its travel solutions and defining its sourcing strategies based on those personas and the needs of those types of travelers.

Rodriguez said Microsoft has four different traveler types. Letting machines do the number crunching is making the travel team ""very efficient listeners."" She said, ""We have a lot of data streams that we can integrate together, and we can really get to the key messages that travelers are throwing to us.""

Using Emirates as an example, Rodriguez said, ""If we see that [the data] of very frequent travelers who have a dominant preference for Emirates is telling us certain things, we can take that information back to Emirates for more strategic sourcing and business decisions."" Microsoft is looking at real patterns of a group of high-value travelers attached to actual dollars, and that gives the company a stronger negotiating position than anecdotal feedback.

Having that kind of data for the travel program overall has offered a totally different lens through which to view the structure the program, as well. Microsoft actually has hard data that shows its road warriors always book online; those travelers want to make changes on the go and want to be able to self-serve a lot of those changes. ""Their problem is that it`s really hard to make changes on the go,"" said Rodriguez. ""That`s completely different from other types of travelers, but we need to figure out how to solve for it."" Infrequent travelers need more recommendations and the company is using machine learning to solve for that as well.

While Microsoft is well known as a first mover in pushing smarter data through its booking tools and increasing relevance and efficiency for its travelers, Rodriguez sees sourcing innovation as the broadest machine learning opportunity for travel managers right nowif they`ll take the leap.

""As a travel manager, you [need to] understand the potential of machine learning for your own benefit,"" she said. ""People need to embrace it, instead of saying, `Oh, you`re doing that because you`re Microsoft,` or, `You`re doing that and that`s really cool, but I don`t know anything about AI or machine learning and I`m too scared to dig in.`"""
3,Maximising the Effectiveness of Your Campaigns with Machine Learning,"While most businesses recognise the power of big data and analytics, few have yet to unlock the true potential of data through machine learning, writes Zendesk data scientist Dr Chris Hausler (pictured below).

Marketers have known that the foundation of customer loyalty is strong relationships. In the early days, building these relationships meant face-to-face interactions and phone calls.

Today, the rise of e-commerce, multiple communication channels and the proliferation of mobile devices has meant that consumer behaviour has significantly shifted. We now demand access to immediate information and want our issues to be solved instantly at the click of a button.

Understanding big data and analytics

While consumers have been busy adapting to technological change at an exponential rate, they have also been happy to share more and more information. As a result, marketers are now tracking a customer’s engagement history with their brand through a range of data sources such as social media, purchase history and customer support tickets.

However, while most businesses recognise the power of big data and analytics, few have yet to unlock the true potential of data through machine learning.

The shift towards personalisation

In the past, marketers would use a ‘batch and blast’ approach for email and direct mail campaigns to reach potential buyers. But today, more marketers are personalising content for their customers, and this requires sophisticated machine learning technologies, more broadly referred to as predictive analytics.

Advances in machine learning automatically surface patterns and actionable insights from vast data sets - and do so in real time. This has made it easy for marketers to react quickly to a wide range of customer behaviours on a massive scale. By delivering immediate advice on the best way to engage or follow up with a customer, machine learning is powering a new level personalised service.

Predicting customer behaviour

Machine learning technologies can combine basic customer demographic and purchase data with behavioural cues like email or website interactions, or how discounts affect buying patterns, to offer much deeper insight into consumers’ true intent. ‘Clustering’ and ‘propensity’ models can be used to determine how likely different customers are to actually make a purchase at any given time. ‘Collaborative’ filtering models can help marketers predict what products or services customers are most likely to buy based mainly on what other customers (with similar traits) have bought together in the past. Amazon of course has made this type of model ubiquitous with its “people who bought this product also bought…” recommendations.

Indeed, in the next 10 years we could see machine learning systems capable of understanding the nuances of human language. Yann LeCun, who leads Facebook AI Research, recently said: “We might see the emergence of considerably more intelligent AI agents for dialog systems, question-answering, adaptive robot control, and even planning.”

Beware the creepy factor

A few words of caution though when using machine learning and predictive analytics for your marketing campaigns. It’s always important for you to tell your customers what data you are collecting and why.

Don’t hide opt-ins and unsubscribes in the tiniest print somewhere at the bottom of a registration form or email. If this means capturing a little less data than before, so be it. But do use the data you have intelligently. Marketers should always focus on how to use data to improve the customer’s experience, not just the company’s bottom line.

Brands need to allow customers to edit their data, as well as explain why their algorithms are making specific recommendations and allow customers to give feedback on whether the recommendation was helpful or relevant.

Marketers need to find new ways to cater to a constantly changing audience. It’s clear that we are facing a new revolution in the way that businesses serve their customers, as technological advancements make it possible to replace humans with intelligent algorithms. The scale of the change happening makes machine learning a priority not only for global businesses such as Netflix, Facebook and Google, but for all businesses."
3,4 machine learning breakthroughs from Google's TPU processor,"Google is nothing if not ambitious about its machine learning plans. Around this time last year it unveiled its custom Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) hardware accelerator designed to run its TensorFlow machine learning framework at world-beating speeds.

Now, the company is providing details of exactly how much juice a TPU can provide for machine learning, courtesy of a paper that delves into the technical aspects. The info shows how Google's approach will influence future development of machine learning powered by custom silicon.

1. Google's TPUs, like GPUs, address division of machine learning labor

Machine learning generally happens in a few phases. First you gather data, then you train a model with that data, and eventually you make predictions with that model. The first phase doesn't typically require specialized hardware. Phase two is where GPUs come into play; in theory you can use a GPU for phase three as well.

With Google's TPU, phase three is handled by an ASIC, which is a custom piece of silicon designed to run a specific program. ASICs are good at integer calculations, which are needed when making predictions from models, while GPUs are better at floating-point math, which is vital when training models. The idea is to have specialized silicon for each aspect of the machine learning process, so each specific step can go as fast as possible.

Strictly speaking, this isn't a new approach. It's an extension of the pattern developed when GPUs were brought into the mix to speed up training. Google demonstrates a method to take the next steps with that paradigm, especially as hardware becomes more flexible and redefinable.

2. Google's TPU hardware is secret -- for now

For an operation with Google's scale and finances, custom hardware provides three advantages: It's faster, it solves the right problem at the right level, and it provides a competitive edge the company can share -- albeit on its own terms.

Right now, Google is using this custom TPU hardware to accelerate its internal systems. The feature isn't yet available through any of its cloud services. And don't expect to be able to buy the ASICs and deploy them in your boxes.

The reasons are straightforward enough. Reason one: Anything that provides Google with a distinct competitive advantage is going to be kept as close to the vest as possible. TPUs allow machine learning models to run orders of magnitude faster and more efficiently, so why give away or even sell the secret sauce?

Reason two: Google offers items to the public only after they've been given a rigorous internal shakedown. It took years for Kubernetes and TensorFlow to become publicly available, both of which Google had used extensively inside the company (though in somewhat different forms).

If anything from the TPU efforts makes it to public use, it'll be through the rent-in-the-cloud model -- and odds are it'll be a generation behind whatever the company is working on internally.

3. Google's custom-silicon approach isn't the only one

Google elected to create its own ASICs, but there's another possible approach to custom silicon for running machine learning models: FPGAs, processors that can be reprogrammed on the fly.

FPGAs can perform math at high speed and with high levels of parallelism, both of which machine learning needs at most any stage of its execution. FPGAs are also cheaper and faster to work with than ASICs out of the box, since ASICs have to be custom-manufactured to a spec.

Microsoft has twigged to the possibilities provided by FPGAs and unveiled server designs that employ them. Machine learning acceleration is one of the many duties that hardware could take on.

That said, FPGAs aren't a one-to-one solution for ASICs, and they can't be dropped into a machine learning pipeline as-is. Also, there aren't as many programming tools for FPGAs in a machine learning context as there are for GPUs.

It's likely that the best steps in this direction won't be toolkits that enable machine learning FPGA programming specifically, but general frameworks that can perform code generation for FPGAs, GPUs, CPUs, or custom silicon alike. Such frameworks would have more to work on if Google offers its TPUs as a cloud resource, but there's already plenty of targets they can start addressing right away.

4. We've barely scratched the surface with custom machine learning silicon

Google claims in its paper the speedups possible with its ASIC could be further bolstered by using GPU-grade memory and memory systems, with results anywhere from 30 to 200 times faster than a conventional CPU/GPU mix. That's without addressing what could be achieved by, say, melding CPUs with FPGAs, or any of the other tricks being hatched outside of Google.

It ought to be clear by now that custom silicon for machine learning will drive the development of both the hardware and software sides of the equation. It's also clear Google and others have barely begun exploring what's possible."
3,New IBM security tool uses machine learning to help businesses detect phishing,"A new machine-learning based security solution from IBM could help businesses detect phishing sites up to 250% faster than other methods. Announced via a blog post on Monday, the cognitive phishing detection feature is part of the IBM Security Trusteer platform.

When it comes to hacking, phishing is one of the oldest tricks in the book. It has stayed around for so long, in part, because it still works. According to IBM Security research cited in the post, some 30% of phishing emails are opened by targeted recipients. Phishing works well because it capitalizes on the fact that humans are typically the weakest link in an organization`s cybersecurity. Additionally, the attacks are becoming more advanced and harder to detect at first glance, the post said.

The effects of a phishing attack are felt quickly. More than 70% of user credentials were stolen within the first hour of a phishing attack. However, by using machine learning, IBM`s new capability is able to flag a site for phishing in just a few minutes, the post said.

Moreover, sophisticated machine learning algorithms continually raise detection accuracy over time, dropping false positive rates lower than 1 percent,"" the post said.

The new cognitive phishing detection feature was developed with help from the IBM Cyber Security Center of Excellence at Ben-Gurion University in Israel as well. It works by looking at unstructured website data like URLs, images, text, and more, the post said. It also examines the use of a company logo and the wording on the site to see if the use of the company assets are legitimate.

The goal of the tool is to detect a phishing site and alert the affected users. It also ""issues a protection layer,"" the post said, in order to keep users from going to the site. The tool also alerts the affected brand that the phishing site was trying to mimic, so it can take the proper precautions to protect itself.

""It can accurately identify a wide variety of phishing pages, including those that only present users with an image to elude content analysis and those that deliver dynamic content to the page to evade web crawlers,"" the post said.

IBM`s cognitive phishing detection isn`t the first time the company has utilized its cognitive computing prowess to enhance cybersecurity. In February 2017, the company announced the availability of Watson for Cyber Security, which uses natural language processing to examine security documents and fill in the gaps caused by a lack of cybersecurity professionals.

The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers

IBM`s new cognitive phishing detection capability uses machine learning to help businesses detect a phishing site up to 250% faster than traditional methods.

According to IBM Security research, more than 70% of users` credentials are compromised within the first hour of a phishing attack.

IBM also recently launched Watson for Cyber Security, using natural language processing to gain insights from security documents."
3,Machine learning proves its worth to business,"Machine learning couldn’t be hotter. A type of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn to perform tasks and make predictions without explicit programming, machine learning has caught fire among the hip tech set, but remains a somewhat futuristic concept for most enterprises. But thanks to technological advances and emerging frameworks, machine learning may soon hit the mainstream.

Consulting firm Deloitte expects to see a big increase in the use and adoption of machine learning in the coming year. This is in large part because the technology is becoming much more pervasive. The firm’s latest research shows that worldwide more than 300 million smartphones, or more than one-fifth of units sold in 2017, will have machine learning capabilities on board.

“New chip technology in the form of central processing units, graphics processing units, or dedicated field-programmable gate arrays will be able to provide neural network processing at prices, sizes, and power consumption that fit smartphones,” says Stuart Johnston, leader of the technology, media, and telecommunications practice at Deloitte.

“This hardware added to machine learning software will enable native programs designed to mimic aspects of the human brain’s structure and function, and will be applied to areas such as indoor navigation, image classification, augmented reality, speech recognition, and language translation,” Johnston says. “What that means from a day-to-day user perspective is that complicated tasks will be easier, will be more personalized, faster, and have greater privacy.”

Companies in various industries are already using or experimenting with machine learning technologies. Here is a look at how three companies are tapping machine learning to great business effect.

Pinning hopes on data-rich images

Social media site Pinterest began dabbling with machine learning in 2014, when it started investing heavily in computer vision technology and created a small team of engineers focused on reinventing the ways people find images.

Less than a year later the company launched “visual search,” a new tool that does not require text queries to search for information. “For the first time, visual search gave people a way to get results even when they can’t find the right words to describe what they’re looking for,” says Mohammad Shahangian, head of data science at Pinterest.

Visual search is powered by deep learning, a version of machine learning that taps into deeper neural networks, and allows Pinterest to automatically detect objects, colors, and patterns in any pin's image and recommend related objects. There are more than 200 million visual searches on Pinterest every month, in addition to 2 billion text searches, Shahangian says.

In the summer of 2016, visual search evolved as Pinterest introduced object detection, which finds all the objects in a pin’s image in real time and provides related results.

“Today, visual search has become one of our most-used features, with hundreds of millions of visual searches every month, and billions of objects detected,” Shahangian says. “Now, we’re introducing three new products on top of our visual discovery infrastructure.”

Pinterest has one of the largest collections of data-rich images on the internet. “We use machine learning to constantly rank and scale 75 billion dynamic objects, from buyable pins to video, and show the right pin to the right person at the best time,” Shahangian says. “Our core focus is helping people discover compelling content, such as products to buy, recipes to make, and projects to try, and machine learning helps us provide a more personalized experience.”

As Pinterest expands its international audience, it’s vital that its service be personalized for people regardless of where they live, what language they speak, or what their interests are, Shahangian says. “Using machine-learned models, we've increased the number of localized pins for countries outside the U.S. by 250 percent over the past year,” he says. “Now each of the more than 150 million people who visit Pinterest monthly see pins most relevant to their country and language.”

In additional, machine learning predicts the relevance of a promoted pin on the site as well as its performance, helping improve the user experience with promoted ideas from businesses.

“We recently added deep learning to our recommendations candidate pipeline to make related pins even more relevant,” Shahangian says. “Pinterest engineers have developed a scalable system that evolves with our product and people’s interests, so we can surface the most relevant recommendations. By applying this new deep learning model, early tests show an increase in engagement with related pins by 5 percent globally.”

Pinterest is constantly developing technologies with the latest in machine learning “to build a visual discovery engine, including making advancements in object detection and scaling an ever-growing corpus of data and the world's data-rich set of images, to people around the world,” Shahangian says.

Building high-dimensional models

Another company using machine learning, software provider Adobe Systems, has worked with supervised and unsupervised machine learning, as well as statistical models to help run its business for years, according to Anandan Padmanabhan, vice president of Adobe Research.

With the transition of Adobe’s business to a cloud-based subscription offering, there were two fundamental drivers that resulted in a need for large-scale machine learning within the company: online channels becoming the primary source for acquiring customers, and the need for driving product engagement and retention at scale across millions of customers. In addition, the data captured on customer engagement with a particular product are far more detailed through machine learning.

“Adobe captures this event-level longitudinal data across product usage, marketing, and customer support to build various types of predictive models,” Padmanabhan says. These include paid conversion and retention models, customer retention models, automated feature extraction and segmentation, upsell and cross-sell models, and optimal allocation and segment-based forecasting models.

The tools the company has used for its machine learning efforts include Python Scikit-learn, Spark ML, SAS, and proprietary in-house methods.

Machine learning methods have helped the company build individual-level, high-dimensional models, Padmanabhan says. “Previously, Adobe leveraged statistical tools for building more aggregated models that would ignore individual-level heterogeneity altogether,” he says.

Among the key benefits of machine learning for Adobe is a greater understanding of the marginal impact of paid media, which has resulted in the improved allocation of media touch points across various selling channels; and the ability to understand individual customer propensities and lifecycle stages, which helps drive marketing campaigns.

The company has also seen improved customer engagement through a better understanding of how individual products are used and through responses to marketing campaigns, which has led to more customized products and customer support experiences. That, in turn, has helped with customer retention.

In addition, Adobe has seen improvements in enterprise sales and territory planning, which drive higher sales efficiencies; and the development of a consistent way of defining and analyzing key performance indicators across the business, which has allowed the company to evaluate all campaigns in a common framework.

Given the success so far, the company is looking for other options to take advantage of machine learning. “There is a strong push within Adobe to leverage machine learning in managing all aspects of the customer experience,” Padmanabhan says.

Managing risk for customers

At LexisNexis Risk Solutions (LNRS), a provider of financial risk management services, machine learning helps customers protect against identity theft, money laundering, benefit scams, health care fraud, bad debt, and other risks.

LNRS began using machine learning several years ago to analyze and extract information from extremely large and heterogeneous data pools, to create graphs and make predictions about events, says Flavio Villanustre, vice president of technology architecture and product at LNRS.

The company uses mostly homegrown machine learning tools based on HPCC Systems, an open source, massive parallel-processing computing platform for big data processing and analytics.

The platform “gives us advantages when dealing with complex models and needing scalability to apply to very large and diverse data sets,” Villanustre says. On top of the HPCC platform, LNRS designed its own domain-specific abstractions in the form of domain-specific languages such as Scalable Automated Linking Technology, a sophisticated record linkage tool, and Knowledge Engineering Language, which combines graph analysis with machine learning capabilities.

Prior to machine learning, modeling through algorithms required people to understand the particular problem domain, extract facts from the existing data, and write large, “heuristics based” programs that used conditional rules to model different possible outcomes from the incoming data, Villanustre says. “These earlier systems required experts to sift through data to understand reality and describe it through conditional statements that a computer could understand,” he says. “This was very tedious, hard work, and better left to computers.”

Machine learning changed that by letting computers extract those facts and represent reality through statistical equations-based models instead, Villanustre says. “This saves countless hours of domain experts’ time and allows them to work with data sets that humans would struggle to deal with otherwise,” he says. “The resulting computer programs are more compact, easier to implement, and more efficient.”

LNRS uses machine learning to describe complete networks of organizations and individuals to identify fraud rings. It also uses the technology to assess and make predictions on credit and insurance risk, identify fraud in health-care-related transactions, and help capture criminals.

“Machine learning is at the core of everything that we do,” Villanustre says. And the company is looking into the latest iterations of the technology. Some of the recent developments around deep belief networks -- generative graphical models composed of multiple layers of latent variables with connections between the layers -- and deep learning are proving to be promising fields of applications, he says.

“It is always important for us to validate these new methodologies with the laws and regulations of the respective countries in which we work to ensure that they can be used in ways that maximize the benefit to individuals and society,” Villanustre says.

Machine learning in the mainstream

The adoption of machine learning is likely to be diverse and across a range of industries, including retail, automotive, financial services, and health care, says Johnston of Deloitte.

In some cases, it will help transform the way companies interact with customers, Johnston says. For example, in the retail industry, machine learning could completely reshape the retail customer experience. The improved ability to use facial recognition as a customer identification tool is being applied in new ways by companies such as Amazon at its Amazon Go stores or through its Alexa platform.

“Amazon Go removes the need for checkouts through the use of computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep or machine learning, and I expect many shopping centers and retailers to start exploring similar options this year,” Johnston said.

The fact that common devices such as smartphones will be equipped with machine learning capabilities means the technology will no longer be limited to theoretical or highly selective applications.

“Examples of emerging smartphone technologies powered by machine learning include things like programs that determine users’ moods and emotions through pressure sensors, programs that make health and life predictions using health data and programs that detect surrounding objects,” Johnston says.

Outside of smartphones, we will also see machine learning emerge in drones, tablets, cars, virtual or augmented reality devices, medical tools, and a range of IoT devices, making it available to industries that use those products, Johnston says."

He had been searching for a new solution to Albert Einstein’s equations of general relativity, and at last he could see in his numbers and symbols a precise description of how space-time?—?the four-dimensional universal fabric those equations describe?—?could be wrapped into a spinning ball.

3,Field widens for commercial drone use beyond photography,"July 21--ST. LOUIS -- Drones have come a long way from the gas engine-powered model airplane craze of the 1950s and '60s.

Evolved from their model plane and military origins, today's unmanned aircraft are being put to work by businesses and public agencies in the St. Louis region.

Brian Borton, operations manager with Gateway Drone Resources, said the drones his company uses capture images that, coupled with advanced software, can help clients in agriculture, utilities and construction understand their land and projects better.

For example, Borton said, his Chesterfield company uses technology that strips away vegetation in an image to provide a look at soil and drainage on farm land.

Commercial drone spending is projected to exceed $20 billion in roughly five years. Drone companies such as Borton's, which hired two people in July to boost its payroll to about a dozen, are also growing, adding revenue and jobs to the local economy.

As more drones take to the skies, more local governments are passing laws with restrictions on them, often citing privacy concerns.

Borton said a recently passed drone ordinance in Chesterfield hasn't hurt his business but presents a challenge.

The Chesterfield Chamber of Commerce recently hired his company to fly over a park to photograph a series of concerts. Though Borton said the company had permission to fly there, the park superintendent prohibited it. Borton said he and a team had to adjust their equipment to work from a distance.

""The park superintendent was looking out for the public good,"" Borton said.

Borton said he knows some people are suspicious of drones, and he believes some local efforts to restrict the devices are a ""knee-jerk reaction"" to those worries.

But he doesn't fault all efforts to restrict drone use. ""Some are trying to pass good ordinances that provide a reasonable amount of protection for residents,"" he said.

As of this month, the National Conference of State Legislatures reports lawmakers in at least 38 states are considering drone-related measures.

St. Louis drone specialist Robert Haller operates an aerial cinematography company that produces footage for commercial retailers and news outlets. Its footage has also been part of a documentary centered on Ferguson and a film directed by actor and screenwriter William H. Macy.

Haller's company, St. Louis Drones, usually has two people, a pilot and a navigator, on video shoots. Two ""spotters"" are added to the team on larger projects, Haller said.

In line with Federal Aviation Administration rules, the company is certified to operate drones.

""We go above and beyond,"" Haller said of safety precautions the company takes, including notifying residents and towers that they will be filming in a particular area.

The video production company began using drones in 2014. The devices it uses are larger and cost tens of thousands more than some of the cheap drones on the market.

The cameras on a $800 DJI Mavic Pro, Haller said, for example, can't compare to the capabilities of the larger, more expensive equipment his company relies on.

That's his argument against worries about nefarious drone use: The technical abilities of recreational drones aren't advanced enough yet.

Law enforcement agencies are also putting drones to work. The Madison County Sheriff's Office bought its first drone this year for about $30,000. Officials say they hope it will reduce the department's reliance on a St. Louis County helicopter for search-and-rescue missions.

With the ability to carry up to 15 pounds, the roughly 4.5-square-foot carbon fiber drone can transport objects such as life vests, ropes, first aid equipment and telephones to people in danger without jeopardizing personnel, Patrol Deputy Darren Onwiler said.

""If we save one person because we have a drone, you can't put a value on it,"" Onwiler said.

Five officers and one dispatcher are authorized by the department to operate the aircraft.

The drone runs on six batteries, has six motors, a 360-degree camera, GPS capabilities, and is wired with a tracker to locate it if it becomes lost. The drone will be linked to Google Maps to trace where it flies, Onwiler said. The device also has LED lights for when its in the air at night.

During a simulation outside the sheriff's office in Edwardsville last month, the drone camera flying 200 feet in the air could read the ""Danger"" label on a can placed a couple feet off the ground, using about a third of the camera's optical power.

Onwiler also demonstrated the drone's ability to decipher temperature differences through thermal imaging.

The device's advanced capabilities could raise questions about privacy, Onwiler knows.

""Anything we do we are obviously at risk of complaint,"" he said.

He added the department is committed to respecting people's constitutional rights.

""Nothing will change in terms of that just because we have a drone,"" he said."
3,China to begin commercial production of powerful drone,"China has begun commercial production of its most powerful drone, the CH-5 Rainbow.

The drone is ""half of the price"" of the United States' Reaper or Predator B, the world's first unmanned aerial vehicle, The South China Morning Post reported.

According to Wang Song, a professor of aeronautic science and engineering at Beihang University, the $16.9 million Reaper is also the world's most expensive drone.

""The CH-5 may come in at less than half of the price,"" Wang said.

China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation will begin producing 10 to 20 units a year, according to the Chinese analyst.

""This should meet the early demand,"" Wang said, adding China is ready to export its latest drone to interested buyers seeking a UAV with similar capacities as the Reaper.

The CH-5 can be equipped with a maximum of 16 air-to-ground missiles and stay airborne for nearly 48 hours, according to Shi Wen, the drone's chief designer.

Modifications can allow the drone to fly for up to 120 hours with a range of 6,200 miles.

The performance of the CH-5 ""leaves the Predator series in the dust,"" Shi said.

But Wang said the Chinese drone couldn't climb as high as the Reaper, which makes it susceptible to certain kinds of anti-aircraft systems.

The Rainbow flight was conducted successfully at a military airport in Hebei province, according to state news agency Xinhua.

Countries like Iraq may already be deploying Chinese drones to fight the Islamic State.

In 2015, Iraq's defense ministry released a video shows a missile attack on an IS target by a CH-4B drone, which is a third of the size of the CH-5."

3,Unified Inboxs IoT messaging platform is now available on IBM Cloud,"Singapore based intelligent IoT messaging company, Unified Inbox, has announced the global availability of its UnificationEngine platform on the IBM Cloud. Using voice and text messaging through the UnificationEngine, people can remotely control and receive alerts and notifications from their smart home, smart enterprise, and smart city devices.

The platform allows users to communicate in natural language on over 20 different communications channels, including SMS, email, social media, messaging, and chat platforms, without the need for a separate app. With UnificationEngine on the IBM Cloud, developers can integrate high-performance cloud services into their IT environments.

Last year, IBM and Unified Inbox collaborated to provide businesses with its IoT messaging platform using IBM Watson. The collaboration entailed IBM giving Unified Inbox, an IBM Cloud (Bluemix) partner, API and platform support.

IBM Watson was powering the natural language and conversational intelligence of UnificationEngine, which made it possible for users to communicate with their appliances. The collaboration combined the AI capabilities of IBM Watson and the human to machine IoT communications engine of Unified Inbox, in a bid to deepen conversations between people and machines.

According to Unified Inbox, Bosch is one of the companies that has started to integrate the UnificationEngine into its products. It has developed an integration of UnificationEngine into its surveillance cameras. Leveraging UnificationEngines unified API, its surveillance cameras can communicate with users like security officers via text messaging and videos to provide them with real-time information.

Through this integration, users are able to access a situation beforehand and plan the best course of action to address specific security situations. They can monitor crowd movements, such as queue build-ups. Using voice command or text messages, they can retrieve images and video footage from any point in time on any communications platform through SMS, social media or messaging apps.

Were excited to have the security, interoperability, and convenience of UnificationEngine now be available globally to users, developers, and manufacturers through the IBM Cloud catalog, said Toby Ruckert, CEO, Unified Inbox.

Because UnificationEngine scales with smart home, enterprise, and city solutions to make IoT solutions both frictionless and fun, we cant wait to see what existing users like Bosch and new IBM Cloud users will create!

According to the company, users can integrate their application with UnificationEngine by registering as a developer and entering the apps name. The user can then add a connector and creating a user. Upon adding a connection the user can start sending UnificationEngine messages."

Robots are products of the future. Though robotics companies are facing financial pressure in the short run, their products will reshape society, a general manager of SoftBank Robotics told the Global Times on Wednesday. The company's flagship product, the humanoid robot Pepper, has been struggling as its debt mounted to $274 million, the Japanese financial news outlet Nikkei Asian Review reported on July 12. Designed to be a genuine day-to-day companion, Pepper is able to perceive emotions and interact actively with humans.Besides Pepper, the company has also developed two other robots: NAO and the upcoming ROMEO.Pepper, the company's major service robot product, has already been used in places like Nescafé sales outlets in Japan, the company's website showed. However, it has not been put on the Chinese market yet, although Foxconn Technology Group, a major original equipment manufacturer of US technology giant Apple, has started to produce it. China has been seen as a booming service robot market. The country's spending on robotic systems, which include industrial, service and consumer robots and after-market robotic hardware, is expected to hit $29 billion in 2020, industry research firm IDC forecast in April.Investment on robotics deployed in the consumer industry is expected to grow 38 percent annually until that year. After Pepper was unveiled in 2014, with backing coming from Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding and Foxconn, some domestic robot manufacturers came up with products with a similar look and function, Leo Chen, China key account manager of SoftBank Robotics, told the Global Times. ""The hardware of some robots [made by Chinese companies] still lags behind the products made by their foreign competitors,"" he said. Intelligent robots require complex algorithms, so SoftBank Robotics has a positive outlook on robotics. ""The recent purchase of Boston Dynamics, which has a strong academic background,"" will help the company's robotics sector to grow, Chen added."

3,IT Giant Fujitsu Is Planning to Deploy Multiple Blockchain Business Models,"IT giant Fujitsu has revealed new details on its plans to monetize its work on Hyperledger`s Fabric blockchain.

One of several companies credited with helping build the core of the enterprise-focused distributed ledger platform, Fujitsu is now embarking on what it described as a two-fold plan to commercialize its progress.

As additional tweaks are made to the modified version of the codebase, the Japanese firm intends to begin selling customers services designed to increase the efficiency of both internal corporate operating systems and operations that connect potential clients.

A Fujitsu spokesperson told CoinDesk:

""We don`t intend to limit it to one business model, but want to use it various ways. As blockchain becomes faster, we hope to achieve stable responsiveness even when user numbers swell.""

The news follows a CoinDesk report last month that the firm`s research arm had achieved 1,350 transactions per second using the software, a volume it claimed was required by clients seeking ""high performance.""

As a result of this development, Fujitsu is now seeking to gain customers in parallel with IBM, the only other company to reveal plans to monetize Fabric. But for now, it`s open to having other evangelists in the market.

A Fujitsu spokesperson said the company isn`t concerned about building its system using the same technology as an ostensible competitor."

3,57% of large corporations consider blockchain deployment,"Two-thirds of organisations expect blockchain to be integrated into their systems by the end of 2018.

Nearly six in 10 (57%) large corporations globally are either actively considering, or are in the process of deploying blockchain technology.

This is according to a Juniper Research study, titled: Which Industries are the Best Fit for Blockchain? (https://www.juniperresearch.com/document-library/white-papers/which-industries-are-the-best-fit-for-blockchain?utm_source=juniperpr&utm_campaign=futureofblockchain2017pr1&utm_medium=email). The research provides a guide to the key characteristics that determine whether companies should consider blockchain development, and highlights rapid progress in enterprise rollouts of blockchain technology.

Almost 400 company founders, IT executives and managers responded to the survey.

""Two-thirds (66%) of organisations expected blockchain to be integrated into their systems by the end of 2018,"" reveals the report.

""Settlement, land registry and digital fiat currency were identified as ‘best fit' opportunities for blockchain deployment, but for each of these opportunities the scale and variety of barriers were significant.

""While awareness of blockchain and its benefits had increased dramatically in the past 12-18 months, there was the danger that companies might seek to deploy blockchain without having first considered alternative options."" Research author Dr Windsor Holden explains: ""In many cases, systemic change, rather than technological, might be a better and cheaper solution than blockchain, which could potentially cause significant internal and external disruption."" The research further found companies may have underestimated the scale of the blockchain challenge. For issues such as interoperability, the proportion of survey respondents expressed concerns progressively increased as companies proceed towards full deployment, while concerns also rose sharply regarding client refusal to embrace blockchain.

The PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Global FinTech Report 2017 (https://www.pwc.com/jg/en/issues/redrawing-the-lines-fintechs-growing-influence-on-the-financial-services-2017.html) reveals 77% of 1 300 interviewed global organisations said they expect to adopt blockchain as part of an in-production system or process by 2020.

""Banks, institutions and even governments are looking at blockchain technology as a secure storage and distribution solution. There is growing demand across the globe to understand the implications of blockchain and how to respond to it,"" notes PwC.

In May, IBM introduced the IBM Blockchain Founder Accelerator (https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/accelerator/) to help organisations and enterprise developers address key challenges in adopting blockchain technology.

With the right network of participants collaborating on the blockchain, the benefits can be exponential,"" says Marie Wieck, GM of blockchain technology at IBM. ""IBM is proactively building solutions and entire blockchain ecosystems across a broad range of industries and we are sharing our expertise and resources to help more organisations quickly set up their networks."" Jan van Rooyen, strategic solutions lead at supply chain IT company Resolve, says: ""One challenge faced by organisations in blockchain deployment is access to the digital world. Access is driven by availability and cost. Availability of industrial-scale, very fast access to the Internet by everyone at all corners of the country, at a fraction of the cost of current services. The uptake of blockchain for non-financial use cases has been slower in SA, but that is changing as its potential impact in environments, such as the supply chain, is better understood."""

“Culligan has designed an elegant two-phase interface to leverage the IoT data generated by their connected water softeners: a mobile app for end customers and a web-based portal for dealers,” said David Friedman, CEO and co-founder of Ayla Networks. “The Culligan Connect product takes full advantage of the Ayla IoT platform to deliver a smart home appliance that will add real value for both homeowners and Culligan dealers.” 

Culligan Connect Benefits Extend to Homeowners and Dealers

Easily installed by a trained local technician, the Culligan Connect Wi-Fi accessory can help homeowners: 

Gain peace of mind while at home or away by being able to control their water softener system through a mobile device. Conserve water and energy by tracking water usage. Choose to bypass treated water for outdoor cleaning and watering applications. Receive push notifications or alerts when salt supplies are low or if there’s unexpected water flow when residents are away from home. 

Culligan dealers can use the IoT data generated through the Culligan Connect accessory to: 

Monitor the status and settings of connected water softeners easily, from their desks. Receive diagnostic and system status reports and error alerts remotely, at any time. Track usage data to make sure the system is sized correctly and to predict when it’s time to regenerate the salts. Contact customers when there’s a problem rather than waiting for customers to contact them. Proactively schedule service visits based on individual customers’ needs. Save time and costs by knowing the nature of system errors before sending a truck to the customer’s home. 

The Culligan Connect accessory is currently compatible with Culligan high-efficiency (HE) water softeners in the United States and Canada. Users can download the free mobile app via the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. More information is available at the Culligan website."

3,Google chief funds new machine-learning effort at Princeton's IAS,"A $2 million donation will launch new research at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton to forge an understanding of how machine learning evolves.

Machine learning -- sometimes called the leading edge of artificial intelligence -- is the rapidly developing computer technology behind self-driving cars, complex web searches, medical and science applications, and face and speech recognition. Machine-learning programs synthesize knowledge in a way that's analogous to how children learn. The programs take examples, generalize, and then develop rules and understanding about the world without being taught directly. With time, the programs become better at particular tasks.

""Machine-learning techniques are finding new applications almost daily and are already transforming society in numerous ways."" said Avi Wigderson, who heads the institute's computer-science group at the School of Mathematics. ""But because of the self-teaching aspect they have, their immense size, and the way they evolve, the final algorithms are not well understood by their own designers.""

The gift, from Silicon Valley philanthropists Eric and Wendy Schmidt, will fund a three-year program focusing on the mathematical underpinnings of machine learning. Eric Schmidt is the executive chairman of Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google. Wendy Schmidt is president of the Schmidt Family Foundation. IAS is best known as the academic home of some of the 20th century's greatest mathematical minds, including Albert Einstein, John von Neumann, and Kurt Godel.

3,Enable your Java microservices with advanced resiliency and fault tolerance leveraging Istio,"Building and packaging microservices is one part of the story. Given that a highly salable and distributed microservices deployment is going to face failures at different layers, how do we make these microservices resilient and fault-tolerant? How do we enforce policy decisions, such as fine-grained access control and rate limits? How do we enable timeouts/retries, health checks, etc.? Even though some language-specific frameworks address these issues, the implementation is often framework- or language-specific. If the underlying framework or language changes, the resiliency features need to be reimplemented or ported over. And in some cases, applications also have the responsibility of implementing the code and configuration required for resiliency and fault-tolerance. A service-mesh architecture attempts to resolve these issues by extracting the common resiliency features needed by a microservices framework away from the applications and frameworks and into the platform itself. Istio provides an easy way to create this service mesh. In this developer journey, we demonstrate how to build, deploy, and connect your Java™ MicroProfile microservices, leveraging Istio service mesh. We then show how to configure and use circuit breakers, timeouts/retries, rate limits, and other advanced resiliency features from Istio without changing the application code...(https://developer.ibm.com/)"

3,AT&T 5G headed for 12 U.S. markets this year,"AT&T plans to roll out 5G mobile services in a dozen U.S. markets by the end of the year. But details on the AT&T 5G services have not been released.

AT&T plans to introduce fifth-generation, or 5G, mobile services in a dozen markets by the end of the year, as it aims to become the first U.S. carrier to offer the high-speed wireless network.

The rollout of the AT&T 5G services was sped up by the recent completion of new standards, the company said. In December, international wireless standards body 3GPP finished the new radio specifications that define radio access to the network.

The completed standards provide the specs device and chipset manufacturers need to build 5G products capable of handling data speeds of up to 10 Gbps -- 10 to 20 times faster than the current 4G networks. In a statement, AT&T said it`s ""confident this latest standards milestone will allow us to bring 5G to market faster.""

Verizon plan differs from AT&T 5G strategy

AT&T rivals Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint also plan to offer 5G mobile services. However, the companies, including AT&T, haven`t described in detail the services they would provide.

While AT&T focuses on mobile, Verizon has aimed its initial 5G work at residential broadband services, which the company plans to launch in five markets this year. The higher-frequency range of 5G makes it possible for service providers to deliver high-speed internet to homes wirelessly.

Fifth-generation is expected to support tens of millions of new broadband connections at 50 Mbps or more. The higher speeds on fixed and mobile 5G services can power virtual reality applications, driverless cars and 4K streaming video.

While preparing AT&T 5G services for consumers, the company plans to test the technology with businesses across industries. AT&T said the lower latency of 5G would make it useful in edge computing, an architecture designed for the internet of things.

Despite the ongoing 5G rollouts, carriers are not expected to deliver wide-scale services until at least 2020. Manufacturers will need time to build support in devices, and most service providers are content to wait until they reap the full return on 4G investments."
3,"Verizons First Commercial 5G Deployment to Arrive This Year, with Samsung Tech","Samsung will provide Verizon with 5G Fixed Wireless Access (FWA), the companies have announced.

The companies have already experimented with 5G technologies in trials in seven US cities last year across California, Georgia, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, Texas, and Washington D.C. The trials produced laudable results including sending 5G radio signals to the 19th floor of a building and establishing broadband connection in ling of sight, partial line of sight, and non-line of sight conditions.

Moving ahead, the plan is to launch commercial 5G services in Sacramento starting in the second half of this year. Samsung will provide 5G Radio Access Units, 5G home routers, and 5G radio frequency planning services, and will develop ASIC-based 5G modems and mmWave RFICs for the effort.

In a statement announcing the plans, Verizon SVP Ed Chan suggested that Silicon Valley will provide a strong foundation for the expansion of Verizons 5G services, asserting, Sacramento is an ideal place to begin deploying 5G broadband services, providing a progressive environment for creating future use cases.

3,Blockchain pivot boosts Kodak,"Shares in Kodak, the photography company which has struggled to keep pace with changing technology, more than doubled on Tuesday after the 129-year-old group announced it was launching a blockchain business.

The New York state-based company announced that it was partnering with WENN Digital, part of the London-headquartered WENN media organisation, to create an encrypted digital ledger of ownership rights for photographers, using blockchain - the technology which underpins cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.

Kodak's bet on blockchain technology is the latest in a long line of such moves to fire up investors. When Long Island Iced Tea Corp changed its name to Long Blockchain Corp in late December, its shares initially spiked some 289 per cent.

The internet has made it difficult for photographers to control their image rights, and many traditional sources of their income - such as payments for stock photography - have shrunk since the 1990s.

So Kodak and WENN plan to use the technology to create stronger links between images and their creators. They will also create a cryptocurrency, called KODAKCoin that can be used to pay photographers when an image they have created is used.

""For many in the tech industry, 'blockchain' and 'cryptocurrency' are hot buzzwords, but for photographers who've long struggled to assert control over their work and how it's used, these buzzwords are the keys to solving what felt like an unsolvable problem,"" said Jeff Clarke, Kodak CEO.

Although Kodak was a US corporate giant in the era of celluloid film, it lost ground to Japanese film manufacturers and struggled to adapt to digital photography. Its market capitalisation has slipped to just $US132 million ($169 million).

Kodak's share price rocketed from $US3 at the start of trading to close at $US6.80, up 119 per cent.

Penny stock companies which have announced pivots towards the highly touted technology, hoping to help solve problems from supply chain management to auditing, have experienced similar bumps.

Large companies which have been indirectly linked to blockchain, even though rumours, are also receiving some indirect share price benefits.

When a questionably sourced report appeared online linking Western Union, the money transfer company, to Ripple, the enterprise blockchain start-up, on Friday, Western Union shares climbed from $US19.45 to highs of $US22.21 on Monday."

Source : ProQuest - ICT Monitor Worldwide; Amman [Amman]24 June 2017.

   

Indian IT services giant Infosys says it is working on 50 different blockchain pilots, a clear sign that the demand for the technology is growing like never before.



According to Indias economic daily The Business Line, Infosys has deployed 500 specialists and 1,000 consultants for developing new solutions with the technology.



Blockchain is set to disrupt almost every industry, says Infosys, citing a study by Allied Market Research, which predicted that the market for distributed ledgers alone will reach US$5 billion over the next decade.



So far, banks and financial services firms with extensive branches have used it successfully, but Infosys says many other sectors including retail, governance and healthcare are exploring ways of leveraging this new technology.



Interestingly, most of Infosys pilots are in non-financial services sectors.



Blockchain is a method of recording data a digital ledger of transactions, agreements, contracts anything that needs to be independently recorded and verified. The technology platform gives everyone on the network access to an up-to-date version of the data



With blockchain, you can get a dashboard in which all parties can look at the information and make decisions accordingly, says the companys chief of emerging technology solutions Prasad Joshi.

Machine Learning - Taking Your Security Team to the Next Level","Machine learning is all around us, enriching our online lives every day. We see it with our own eyes when search engines accurately predict what we're looking for after we type only a few letters. We feel it protecting our bank accounts evaluating credit card transactions for signs of fraud. We notice it in selections of articles and ads in online newspapers. We no longer think twice about these conveniences; in fact, it's hard to imagine online life without machine learning.

In relation to cybersecurity, machine learning has been changing the game as a means of managing the massive amounts of data within corporate environments. However, machine learning lacks the innately human ability to creatively solve problems and intellectually analyse events. It has been said time and again that people are a company's greatest asset…"

3,Box Azure support brings along Microsoft machine learning,"Box adds support for Microsoft Azure, which means organizations can take advantage of that service`s AI and machine learning capabilities to improve the file sync-and-share platform.

Azure`s AI and machine learning capabilities are coming to Box, giving Microsoft cloud shops an advantage over organizations that use Box with other providers.

Today, organizations can`t use Box to store files in the Azure cloud. But the two software vendors announced Tuesday they are adding an option for Box customers to select Azure as their primary storage. With the new Box Azure support, organizations will also get artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning capabilities from Microsoft, such as the ability to search within the contents of media files stored in Box.

""It`s cutting edge,"" said Jeff Janovich, former cloud solutions architect at Carlisle Construction Materials, a Box and Azure customer in Carlisle, Pa. ""The search options in Box leveraging AI and machine learning that`ll be awesome.""

Advantages of Box on Azure

Thanks to Microsoft Azure, Box users will be able to conduct more specific searches for information within multimedia content. When users upload a file to Box, Azure machine learning automatically assigns detailed metadata that Box can access during user searches. For example, if a user searches for the word ""chair,"" any video with a chair in it will come up.

Box currently supports other cloud services including Amazon Web Services (AWS), IBM SoftLayer and Google Cloud Platform, but organizations wouldn`t get the AI and machine learning capabilities with those services, Box said.

""Not all platforms are created equal, so Box on Azure might have different functionality than Box on AWS,"" said Jack Gold, principal and founder of J. Gold Associates, an industry analyst firm in Northborough, Mass.

Carlisle Construction Materials has more than six terabytes of media files from its marketing and graphic design departments on Box, so the new AI and machine learning capabilities would greatly help users organize and find those files, Janovich said.

The AI and machine learning capabilities will not be limited to videos, and Box is working with Microsoft on more ways to use the technology in the future, said Jeetu Patel, chief strategy officer at Box.

""This is an area where there is a lot of innovation happening,"" said Eric Klein, director of mobile software at VDC Research in Natick, Mass. ""Microsoft wants to push the accelerator on those initiatives, so I think more capabilities off AI and machine learning will come down the road.""

Azure gets in the zone

Box Zones will let organizations choose which Azure data center they want to store their data in based on their geographic location. Many organizations face stiff regulations about data storage, and many countries force companies to only store data within their borders. Box Zones allows organizations to store files in data centers of supported cloud service providers in the countries of their choice.

""These compliance requirements have held some companies back from using cloud altogether,"" said Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research in Westminster, Mass. ""It`s increasingly more of a requirement, so Box Zones is a big deal.""

Box Zones already uses data centers from AWS and IBM, allowing customers to store data in the countries that those vendors have data centers in. Microsoft has 40 data centers around the world, which the company claims is more than any other cloud provider.

""I`m really impressed with Box`s ability to become a true enterprise player,"" Klein said. ""It`s really a crowded market, but they figure out ways to add features to attract corporate customers.""

Both Box and Microsoft`s sales teams will pitch Box on Azure to prospective buyers as part of the deal. Box support for Azure will be available later this year, the companies said."

3,The many (emerging) faces of machine learning,"You may not realize it, but you probably come across machine learning just about everywhere-in retail, health care, public transportation and more-and it’s only going to increase in ways that we can’t even imagine.

While you probably had conversations with chat bots on websites or calls with customer service-there are many other types of machine learning applications that are silently working behind the scenes, including those that help organizations predict patterns and behaviors.

These apps are able to sift through huge amounts of data and make sense of it-once they have been “taught” what to look for. This has created demand for data scientists to build algorithms that can find patterns to predict outcomes and behaviors.

Now, with automated platforms, such as Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services (AWS) and machine learning libraries, it is easier and faster than ever for data scientists to develop these algorithmic models. And that not only means that you’ll get quicker customer service, but that you’ll also benefit from better, higher quality goods and services.

I’m seeing new applications for machine learning springing up in a variety of industries, and the possibilities are nearly endless. Here are a few examples of apps that are currently in use as well as some that will be available in the near future:

* Defense: Working with satellite imagery, machine learning apps can sift through historical data on improvised explosive device (IED) explosions to help the military predict where these bombs might be located.

* Public transportation: Using satellite imagery, imaging processing technology and historical data, data scientists can help machine learning software identify buses on a satellite map, as well as create an algorithm enabling it to predict where buses may be at any given time of day. To enable the software to “see” the buses with image processing, the data scientists use deep learning and neural networks, which are algorithms that mimic the way the brain works. By predicting these transportation patterns, the software enables transportation authorities to save money, while helping commuters save time.

* Manufacturing: Using historical data, data scientists can build algorithms to predict potential product defects. Since these defects could be based on a number or combination of variables, such as room temperature when and where the parts were manufactured, etc., the more data the software has the better, to help identify the cause of the defects and prevent future problems.

* Health care: Health care providers can predict different types of outcomes using machine learning, such as the likelihood of patients being admitted or readmitted following a hospital stay. These apps are taught to sift through the data and look for patterns based on several variables, such as patients’ medical conditions, when and how often they have refilled their medicine, and the frequency of follow-up doctors’ visits.

* Security: Machine learning apps can help eliminate false alarms at airports, stadiums and other venues, and spot things human screeners might miss. This can not only speed up the security process significantly, but also improve safety.

* Financial services: New algorithms are enabling financial institutions to predict when outstanding loans are going to become delinquent. Similarly, AI-enriched chat bots are providing personalized customer advice to increase loyalty and satisfaction.

* Smart cars: In the future, machine learning will enable cars to learn about their drivers’ needs and their environment. The software could automatically adjust things, like internal temperature, music, and seat position, based on an understanding of specific drivers, and offer real time advice about traffic and road conditions-all while in self-driving mode.

Whether it’s being used today to recognize images or identify patterns from massive volumes of data, the ability of machine learning to predict behaviors and outcomes is having a major impact on many industries and touching many areas of daily life-impacting your safety, health, buying patterns, and the way you work. But it still is such a young field, offering greenfield possibilities that are only now being imagined. Stay tuned. The best is likely yet to come."
3,Machine Learning is Disrupting Life Science Research - For Good,"Essentially, if you take enormous computing power and feed it tremendous amounts of data (e.g., from published research in scientific journals, patient records or other data sets), you get an artificial intelligence network that researchers can interact with in their daily work in a useful way. AI programs can certainly run without any hypotheses and randomly search for data correlations, and this can provide new opportunities; however, the more hypotheses that are entered - for example, whether a drug should have a high safety profile, kill cancer cells, or enforce the growth cells in regenerative medicine - the more robust the output will be since the researchers are coming up with the rationale and guiding the machine to answer the right questions. The good news is that, while AI and machine learning is likely to become an integrated part of life science research, it won’t require a major shift in the way researchers work. If big data and machine learning reach the level of maturity for routine application, researchers will have more time and be able to obtain answers to their research questions more quickly…"

3,"Programmable Deployment of Tensegrity Structures by Stimulus-Responsive Polymers



by Ke Liu, Jiangtao Wu, Glaucio H. Paulino & H. Jerry Qi","Tensegrity structures with detached struts are naturally suitable for deployable applications, both in terrestrial and outer-space structures, as well as morphing devices. Composed of discontinuous struts and continuous cables, such systems are only structurally stable when self-stress is induced; otherwise, they lose the original geometrical configuration (while keeping the topology) and thus can be tightly packed. We exploit this feature by using stimulus responsive polymers to introduce a paradigm for creating actively deployable 3D structures with complex shapes. The shape-change of 3D printed smart materials adds an active dimension to the configurational space of some structural components. Then we achieve dramatic global volume expansion by amplifying component-wise deformations to global configurational change via the inherent deployability of tensegrity. Through modular design, we can generate active tensegrities that are relatively stiff yet resilient with various complexities. Such unique properties enable structural systems that can achieve gigantic shape change, making them ideal as a platform for super light-weight structures, shape-changing soft robots, morphing antenna and RF devices, and biomedical devices.

3,"HPE highlights innovation in software-defined IT, security at Discover","At its Discover conference, HPE pulled back the curtains on firmware security and advances in software-defined IT aimed to reduce costs and increase system flexibility for its users and help it stay ahead of competitors in next-generation infrastructure.

There is plenty of competition in the market for converged and hyper converged data center systems, but at the moment HPE has the lead in composable infrastructure, a term gaining currency in the system management world.

Composable infrastructure allows data center managers to deploy infrastructure resources using software commands, notes Patrick Moorhead, founder of Moor Insights and Strategy.

Initially deployed as a feature on HPE's Synergy family, the idea is that by treating hardware and storage infrastructure as fluid pools of resources that can be deployed at will, enterprises can reduce data center costs and the time it takes to spin up new applications.

""This is an area where HPE has the lead,"" Moorhead says. ""I see this as a continuum where there's converged, hyper converged and then composable infrastructure.""

But the competition, notably Dell-EMC, is closing in on composable IT technology, notes Moorhead. So in Las Vegas, HPE is showing off innovations meant to keep it a step ahead.

Essential to HPE software-defined infrastructure enhancements is HPE OneView 3.1, which will support the company's Gen 10 servers. ""OneView is a huge enabler of our composablity; that’s really the software behind how we take pieces of server storage networking as a fluid resource that can be composed,"" said Doug Strain, server management product manager at HPE.

Among enhancements to OneView is intelligent system tuning, which allows systems to boost processor performance for certain workloads while also modulating frequency using a technique known as jitter smoothing. Jitter smoothing helps ensure that data is not lost while boosting core performance. This enables trading systems in which trade data can not be lost, for example, to take advantage of core boosting when high performance is required.

The new version of OneView also offers more than a dozen preset workload settings to make it easier for customers to tune systems for certain types of applications. The feature includes presets for low latency, graphics processing, web e-commerce and virtualized power-efficient workloads.

HPE is also pushing the boundaries on persistent memory technology, which brings together the performance of DRAM with the persistence of flash. The company essentially has combined a layer of DRAM, a layer of flash and an integrated power source -- a Smart Storage Battery that sits behind the drive cage and plugs into the motherboard through memory slots.

Up to now, HPE has been offering persistent memory in the form of NVDIMM modules, which fit into standard server DIMM slots. Applications in NVDIMM can run much faster in persistent memory than they do in standard block storage devices since data doesn't have to move back and forth between the CPU and the hard drive, for example. Data is also retained if a server crashes.

HPE is announcing at Discover that capacity on NVDIMM modules will be expanded from 8GB to 16GB. But the big advance, also set to be demonstrated this week, will come with terabyte-scalable persistent memory that resides right on the memory bus.

""When you start getting up into terabyte level persistent memory you are starting to open the door for different use cases,"" says Bret Gibbs, HPE's persistent memory product manager.

While NVDIMMS can handle smaller databases, transaction logs and index files, scalable persistent memory can handle large-scale, high-performance systems such as the Hekaton in-memory database for OLTP workloads built into Microsoft SQL server and the systems used by, for example, high-frequency traders.

While NVDIMMs cost more than, say, DRAM modules, persistent memory can lower overall system costs, Gibbs said. Users can get better performance out of their servers using persistent memory, reducing the number of core pairs needed in servers, and since server pricing is often based on the number of cores, overall costs can come down, he noted.

HPE is also touting enhancements to server security at the firmware level via what it calls a ""silicon root of trust."" Although firmware attacks are on the rise, it's a topic that needs a higher profile, according to industry association ISACA. ""Many vulnerabilities are present in an area not frequently addressed within the infrastructure of almost all organizations: firmware,"" ISACA reported in a recent security survey.

HPE is fusing cryptographic algorithms and custom code into the silicon for the iLO firmware chips it builds at its own factories, creating what company officials call a digital ""fingerprint."" Malware would change the bits in the firmware and create a mismatch with the fingerprint embedded in the silicon, which would then prevent the server from booting up until a recovery process is completed.

It's a twist on the hardware root of trust already in place in other systems and mobile devices. The difference is that the silicon root of trust not only protects the UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) -- the modern BIOS -- but all aspects of the firmware management processor and logic that drives the voltage and regulation to get systems up and running, according to Mark Potter, HPE's CTO.

In addition, since the silicon root of trust is essentially burned into the silicon at HPE's own plants, the company can protect firmware along the whole supply chain up to the users' facilities, Potter added. The technology will be available on any HPE server running iLO 5.0.

With the Gen 10 platform, HPE is also offering behavior-analytics security technology it acquired with the purchase of Niara earlier this year, which the company is integrating with Aruba’s ClearPass Policy Manager access control platform. Niara uses machine learning and big data analytics to detect anomalous user behavior, among other things.

The Gen 10 platform also offers the Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite (CSNA) promoted by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) as well as Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2, which the government uses to approve cryptographic modules.

Anyone hoping to go to Las Vegas to get the latest speeds, feeds and pricing information on HPE's updated server lines will be disappointed, though, since the company's new Gen 10 servers are not being officially launched yet. Details on processors, for example, will have to wait until Intel launches its latest generation Xeon chips with Skylake architecture, likely sometime in the third quarter.

HPE did, however, say that the following servers will be released in the third quarter: the ProLiant BL460c Gen10 Server Blade; the ProLiant DL360, DL380 and DL560 Gen10 servers; and the Synergy 480 and 660 Gen10 Compute Modules.

Slated for delivery in the fourth quarter are ProLiant Gen10 models ML110, ML350, DL120, DL160, DL180 and DL580 servers.

One View will eventually rolled out across the breadth of HPE's server system portfolio."

4,Enterprises on average use up to 1000 cloud apps but their CIOs think its just 30 or 40 apps,"In todays digital age, cloud is alike the double edge sword for enterprises and their CIOs. Cloud on one hand offers scalability, manageability and easy deployments in a cost effective way.But on the other hand it remains highly prone to security risks linked with data and applications leading to a new challenge for CIOs.

However, according to Symantec CloudSOC data gathered over the last six months of 2016 showed that the use of cloud apps and services, as well as the data shared and stored in them, is increasing.

Symantecs analysis found that most CIOs think their organizations only use around 30 or 40 cloud apps, despite most enterprises having adopted an average of 928, a difference of more than 2,000 percent.

Though its global data, it reflects a similar scenario for enterprises and CIOs in India as theres increasing uptake and usage of cloud.

From India aspect, yes I mean enterprises are leveraging cloud because it brings them ease of deployment, manageability and elasticity from compute perspective. And we have seen how cloud providers are also very focused on the India market, says Tarun Kaura, Symantecs Director Solutions Product Management, APJ.

Basically, it means that enterprises will look at cloud from overall capex and opex perspective since it provides financial as well as technology benefits, adds Kaura.

And thats where enterprises and CIOs need to act decisively to overcome the security challenge that cloud brings with it. This is in addition to the BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) challenge that CIOs have been trying to address through enterprise mobile device management tools and polices.

But, now the wave of BYOD has also gone past devices and reached the applications or apps level. Today, most users across organizations not just bring their own devices but also different sets of applications installed on their devices."
4,85 percent enterprises will adopt Windows 10 by 2017 end,"Nearly 85 percent of enterprises are expected to adopt the Windows 10 operating system by the end of this year, market research firm Gartner predicted on Tuesday. According to the survey that involved six countries including India, most of the organisations are recognising the need to migrate to Windows 10. “Large businesses are either already engaged in Windows 10 upgrades or have delayed upgrading until 2018. This likely reflects the transition of legacy applications to Windows 10 or replacing those legacy applications before Windows 10 migration takes place,” said Ranjit Atwal, Research Director at Gartner, in a statement. Forty nine percent of respondents said that the security improvements in Windows 10 drove them for the migration, while 38 percent of the respondents said that it was cloud integration capabilities that prompted them to adopt this OS. However, budgetary approval is not straightforward because Windows 10 is not perceived as an immediate business-critical project. “It is not surprising that one in four respondents expect issues with budgeting,” said Atwal. The survey further noted that respondents’ intention to purchase convertible notebooks increased as organisations shifted from the testing and pilot phases into the buying and deployment phases."
4,"Viewership shifting from TV sets to laptops, mobile phones","With players such as Netflix and Hotstar luring viewers with new content, consumers are shifting their viewership from TV sets to devices such as laptops and mobile phones. According to Accenture Digital Consumer Survey, the percentage of Indian consumers who prefer watching shows on TV sets plummeted from 47 percent to 10 percent over the last one year. The global online survey of 26,000 consumers in 26 countries reveals that consumers increasingly prefer to watch TV shows on devices such as laptop and desktop personal computers and smartphones. More than four in 10 consumers (42 percent) said they would rather view TV shows on a laptop or desktop, up from 32 percent in last year’s survey. Thirteen percent said they prefer watching TV shows on their smartphones, compared with 10 percent last year. The decline in TV viewing over the past year tracks with a four-year trend. As recently as 2014, the survey revealed that nearly two-thirds (65 percent) of consumers preferred the TV set for viewing TV shows."

4,Using Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) for Healthcare Data Security,"Healthcare is going mobile and clinicians are utilizing more advanced devices as they cut their cords. But as staff members move around more freely, how can providers ensure that their patients protected health information (PHI) stays secure?

Protecting those devices and the data they access through secure enterprise mobility management tools (EMM) is becoming an increasingly important strategy for organizations.

Enterprise mobility management has matured over the past several years as organizations realize the risks associated with mobile devices, particularly with mobile applications accessing electronic health records and PHI. As security risks surrounding these datasets increase, provider organizations must keep pace with evolving threats.

Healthcare mobility environments are increasingly complex as employees use their own devices to access PHI. Unsecure user devices brought in under BYOD policies and proprietary third party apps leave security holes that hackers will use to bypass network security.

The healthcare industry is highly targeted from a security perspective, Travelers VP Chief Underwriting Officer Mike Thoma told HITInfrastructure.com. The value of healthcare records is so high because there is so much information that can be gleaned from a healthcare record. Addresses, SSNs, payment methods, insurance information as well as the health information of the individual."

Apple will initially start its online store by selling iPhone SE, which will be manufactured in India and the product portfolio, will be expanded as it grows the local production to other models. Two senior industry officials said Apple's online store plans does not require foreign direct investment (FDI) approval in retail since the government allows companies to directly sell online models manufactured locally. The company plans to start assembling of iPhones in Bengaluru by June. ""Apple will initially start its online store by selling iPhone SE which will be manufactured in India and will be in line with government policies.

Best practices for mobile app testing automation","As the number of global smartphone users increases dramatically, the number of mobile apps is also skyrocketing. Already, Apple’s App Store has nearly 2 million apps for sale, while Google Play offers 2.2 million apps for download, according to Business 2 Community. Those numbers are only expected to increase. In terms of market size, Newzoo predicted mobile app revenues will nearly double by 2020 to reach $80.6 billion.

To be successful in this increasingly competitive world, developers can’t afford to take mobile app testing lightly.

Creating a mobile app testing strategy

Though app testing is a vital step in building a successful app, it’s often very challenging and time-consuming because developers must consider the wide variations in devices, operating systems and network conditions. However, since consumers have exceedingly high expectations for their mobile experiences and many apps to choose from, developers must test with a consumer-first mindset.

 

The following are some best practices to follow:

•Take a test-driven approach:

•Test on real devices:

•Automate testing:

•Try different networks:

•Make sure apps are global: 

•Ensure security:

Usability is essential, but security reigns in the mobile app world. Users are very sensitive about the security of their personal data and credentials. Customers simply won’t use an app with known vulnerabilities. To ensure an app’s security, developers should make sure user credentials are encrypted while being authenticated over the network, and passwords should be mandatory. Further, apps should be designed with automatic update capabilities.

In such a fast-paced and hypercompetitive market, companies can’t afford to spend too much time developing apps to stay ahead. Further, in this consumer-driven market, apps must meet the demands of increasingly demanding users who won’t settle for a less-than-stellar user experience. To meet this demand, companies must take new approaches to mobile app testing or risk falling behind."

4,Paytm raises $1.4 billion from Softbank as it looks to take over rival Freecharge in its fold,"India’s leading mobile wallet and payments company Paytm has reportedly raised $1.4 billion from Japanese investor SoftBank in its largest funding to date, months after roping in China’s Alibaba as an investor into its marketplace business unit. Softbank, an early investor in the e-commerce giant Alibaba, will take a seat on the board of Paytm, agency reports said. Paytm will use the funds to expand user base and build financial products, the reports said. The mega deal comes even as the Indian e-commerce sector is abuzz with activity, with Softbank in the midst of transactions aimed at switching its stake in e-commerce major Snapdeal with that in the market leader Flipkart. Softbank has pushed for selling Snapdeal, in which it holds 33 percent equity stake, to Flipkart for $1 billion, and is believed to be mulling investing a similar amount in the combined entity in return. Softbank’s fresh investment in Paytm, it is widely believed, will raise Paytm’s valuation significantly to $7-8 billion, from $5 billion last year when it raised $60 million from Mediatek. Meanwhile, Softbank has already brokered a deal persuading Snapdeal to sell its mobile payments unit Freecharge to Paytm for up to $90 million.

At the conclusion of the proposed mergers and acquisitions, Softbank would have switched its stakeholding in the struggling Snapdeal with that in the market leader Flipkart, and its equity in the smaller wallet company Freecharge with that in the largest firm Paytm. Last week, investor Nexus Ventures reportedly agreed to take a $80 million payout in return for its equity holding in Snapdeal, paving the way for its sale to Flipkart. Earlier in March, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which was widely tipped to be eyeing an entry into India for a long time, picked up a significant equity stake in the newly-formed marketplace business of Paytm, at a time when the incumbents in the country are reeling under operational pressures leading to retrenchments and cut in valuations. Alibaba’s $177 million investment in Paytm Mall, along with $23 million by the private equity player SAIF Partners, is sure to pit it against Amazon India, Flipkart, Shopclues and others, making it one among the most prominent players in the fast-crowding Indian e-commerce industry."

Wearable Devices Communicate Vital Brain Activity Information","Rosalind Picard, ScD, FIEEE and her team at MIT pioneered the use of wearable technology to recognize changes in human emotion. They have made several new discoveries, including that autonomic activity measured through a sweat response is not as general as previously thought, and carries more specific information related to different kinds of brain activity.

""The skin is purely innervated by the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system,"" said Picard. ""We can observe increases in sympathetic brain activation by monitoring subtle electrical changes across the surface of the skin.""

Sympathetic activation occurs when experiencing excitement or stress, whether physical, emotional or cognitive. In some medical conditions, such as epilepsy, it shows significant increases related to certain areas of the brain being activated.

Wristwatch-like devices can employ sensors for continuous, real-time data gathering. Picard explained that changes in electrodermal activity occur as the result of atypical activation in deep regions of the brain. This discovery already has been commercialized for use in seizure monitoring.

Seizures occur when there are abnormal, excessive or synchronous neuronal activity, and can cause convulsions evidenced by violent shaking and loss of control and consciousness.

When someone has recurring seizures, the diagnosis usually is epilepsy. When some regions of the brain, such as those involved with anxiety, pain, stress and memory are activated during a seizure, they can elicit patterns of electrical changes in the skin.

Picard reported her group has built an automated machine learning method that can detect compulsive seizures by combining measures of electrodermal activity on the wrist with measures of motion. The wrist-worn detector is now more than 96 percent accurate for detecting convulsive seizures.

While they have not demonstrated detection of non-convulsive seizures, 42 percent to 86 percent of non-convulsive, complex partial seizures also have significant electrodermal responses.

Picard said other clinical applications for wristband electrodermal monitoring include anxiety, mood and stress monitoring and measuring analgesic responses. ""We know that pain exacerbates anxiety and stress and we are doing more studies to determine how reductions in anxiety and stress could indicate an analgesic response activated by a pain management therapy, said Picard… (https://www.sciencedaily.com/)"

4,Wearable Tech Can Detect Life-Threatening Heart Problems,"Cardiogram last week announced that it has developed a preliminary algorithm to use with the Apple Watch and Android Wear devices to detect atrial fibrillation with higher accuracy than previously validated detection methods.

Wearable Tech Can Detect Life-Threatening Heart Problems

Atrial fibrillation, or AF, affects about 2.7 million Americans, and increases the risk of stroke by five times. Overall, it causes about 15 percent of strokes.

Cardiogram trained a deep neural network using heart rate readings taken from Apple Watches.

The company sent 200 AliveCor mobile electrocardiogram devices to people diagnosed with AF. The test subjects recorded 6,338 mobile ECGs, each associated with a positive or negative atrial fibrillation label generated by the devices.

Cardiogram applied 139 million heart rate measurements to retrain its neural network to predict the average variation in heart rate readings over various time windows.

To validate its architectural model, Cardiogram obtained gold standards from cardioversions -- that is, incidents of returning a patient experiencing AF to a normal sinus rhythm through chemical or electrical treatments.

Cardiogram has been working with medical researchers from UCSF's Health eHeart Study, and a total of 51 patients at UCSF Cardiology wore an Apple Watch during their cardioversions.

Heart rate samples were taken during AF and after cardioversion.

Cardiogram's algorithm was able to detect atrial fibrillation with 98.04 percent sensitivity and 90.2 percent specificity… (http://www.technewsworld.com/)"
4,UMii project highlights potential for urban mobility innovation,"The initial findings of the UMii (Urban Mobility innovation index) project have been presented in the plenary session of the UITP Global Public Transport Summit (15-17 May 2017) in Montréal and highlighted the fact that innovation is more than technology-based.

The findings of the UMii project, initiated by the Dubai Roads and Transport Authority and implemented by the International Association of Public Transport (UITP), in partnership with Future Cities Catapult, also indicated that new types of governance, adapted processes of regulation or different ways to create, plan and collaborate can also have a significant role in enhancing urban mobility. It also highlighted the fact that seemingly minor but smart improvements can make a big difference and, in harnessing them, offer untapped potential for cities.

Key messages for urban leaders from the project focus on the need to share ownership of the city’s strategy with those benefiting from it,  to look at mobility in the wider context of sustainable urban and transportation planning or to explore the power of data.

End-To-End Moodle Mobile Testing Project Chosen For Google Summer Of Code 2017","The twelfth edition of GSOC is also the twelfth where Moodle has been present. Since 2005, Google gives students with above-average computer skills the opportunity and infrastructure to work on real-life problems. Last year, students from Sri Lanka, Canada, India, and Romania made contributions to Moodle’s code, under the wing of Moodle HQ’s David Mudrák and other members of the staff.

This year, only one student was chosen: Diwaka Moturu, a 19-year-old code “magician” from Allahabad. His project, “Improve End-to-End Testing in the Mobile App,” aims to adapt a solution by Sauce Labs to place testing technologies into an automated workflow covering every stage of the development process. It begins by connecting TravisCI with Open Source, a fully-fledged testing management service that offers seamless integration with development and team project management services, including GitHub, Heroku, and Slack.

Then, Moturu, under Mudrák’s guidance, will set out to revamp the existing end-to-end testing framework for Moodle Mobile. This involves upgrading and successfully the following list, as well as related dependencies:

    Node, JavaScript back engine

    Protractor, a testing service for applications using the JavaScript Angular framework

    Gulp, a task automation system

    Appium, an Open Source framework for testing any mobile app

    Selenium, a web application platform that saves test settings for ongoing use

This implementation is expected to reduce the amount of time developers spend testing new functionality for the Moodle Mobile apps for Android and iOS to a fraction of its current status."

Mobile Labs’ flagship solution, deviceConnect™ was included in SD Times’ “A guide to continuous testing tools” in the May 2017 issue. Noted for its ability to improve efficiency and agility, deviceConnect was highlighted by SD Times for its ability to enable automated continuous quality integration and DevOps processes. deviceConnect is also recognized for its ability to help enterprise mobility teams perform automated and manual testing for mobile apps and mobile websites on real devices.

The SD Times also featured Mobile Labs President Dan McFall in the article, “Continuous testing in a fast-paced agile and DevOps world.” In this piece, McFall noted that today’s consumers expect high-level mobile app experiences that simply work and that are easy to use. He argued that it is the demand for quality that drives the demand for testing, and that developers must continuously be developing and testing to meet consumer demand.

McFall further elaborated on the importance of continuous testing for mobile in the May 2017 issue of TEST Magazine. In “Under Construction: Continuous Testing for Mobile,” McFall highlighted the three steps that enterprise mobility teams need to take when planning and executing a successful continuous testing strategy to empower continuous delivery, including careful planning, selecting the right tools and team, and consistent application performance monitoring (APM)."
4,Google testing a new search layout for mobile devices?,"Google might be testing a new search style for mobile devices. We were only able to see it once in action, but, thankfully, we did capture the new style in the screenshots that you see above.

Repeating the search in a different window brought us back to the regular mobile search layout, but here’s a side by side comparison (below) between the new and current search styles.

The new style that Google is testing is clean as it rips off all colors from the titles and links in search results. However, it’s also taking up much more space than the current style. As you can see in the screenshot above, the new style is able to display 3 results in a single view, whereas the current style is able to display 4 search results on the same screen in a single view.

We think Google is in the process of redesigning the mobile search layout, and they were probably only testing while we took notice of it. We’ve tried repeating the search on a number of devices, but the new search layout is not showing up again for us."
4,"Mobility User Experience (Ux)



Mobile app development: understanding UX and UI","Mobile apps are designed to fulfill several business objectives such as to generate new revenue streams, enhance brand equity and to engage users to name a few. Today, the app market is flooded with innumerable apps and due to this, it has become a challenge to compel your target audience to download your app and use it on a regular basis. Hence, it is important to offer a great app and for this there is a need to understand the fundamentals of mobile app development. When it comes to knowing the fundamentals, it is essential to know about UI/UX. This is because the success of a mobile app largely depends on its UI/UX. Due to this, several renowned app development companies like Appinventiv pays a lot of attention on UI/UX design for apps."
4,How to Improve Mobile App Engagement Through Design,"User experiences are crucial to the success of an application. Design something too simple, and you’ll lose out to other groups that can offer more features. Design something too complicated, and most users will delete the app after their first few attempts to use it.

We asked eight entrepreneurs from YEC about what user experience issues or trends designers should consider when creating or revamping their programs."
4,Why the digital user experience is synonymous with brand,"The digital customer experience is becoming as important a differentiator for brands as product and price.

By Ben Davis 

Utilities companies offer a great case study for the growing importance of user experience. Whichever supplier you use, the stuff in the pipes is the same: it’s the service wrapped around the gas/electricity/water that you ultimately pay for.

As competition blossoms in the sector, companies understand that, for some customers, user experience is as much a differentiator as price.

In 2016, British Gas ended its 14-year relationship with media agency Carat and appointed MediaCom, which reportedly best answered the pitch question: ‘How would you turn British Gas into a modern British brand in a modern British society?’

The link between modern brands and usability is without doubt. It is why Uber gets mentioned so often, again a company that provides simply the service wrapped around a taxi ride.

Usability isn’t always a digital trait, of course, but it is increasingly digital, as technology becomes cheaper and offers speed and economies of scale.

Marketing Week recently spoke to British Gas director of brand marketing Margaret Jobling at ISBA’s annual conference. She said: “We have been, at its worst end, a telephone billing business where we send you a paper bill, you call us, and if there’s a problem we will call you. [We’re now] saying we need to move to be digital-first, self-serve, always-on, personalised and targeted in how we talk to our customers.”

Much of that statement relates to digital user experience and shows how the brand is fighting back after a whopping 400,000 customers left British Gas in the first six months of 2016."

Current wearable devices provide relatively accurate measurements on heart rate but not energy expenditure","Using wearable devices to monitor physical activity, particularly step count, is not a new concept. Many wearable fitness trackers also have a heart rate monitor and we’ve previously talked about the accuracy of that data. And if you have one of these devices, you may have noticed that many track energy expenditure, or how many calories you’re burning.

Shcherbina et al from Stanford University developed a wearable sensor evaluation framework to test the accuracy of heart rate and energy expenditure estimates from seven commercially available wearable devices. The Apple Watch, Basis Peak, Fitbit Surge, Microsoft Band, Mio Alpha 2, PulseOn, and Samsung Gear S2 were tested against the clinical gold standards, continuous telemetry and indirect calorimetry, while sitting, walking, running, and cycling. The 60 volunteers included in the study were of diverse backgrounds.  The framework, protocol, and results are publicly accessible, and their three main conclusions are summarized below.

First, the tested devices can produce heart rate data with acceptable error for walking, running, and cycling. The lowest error rates were observed for cycling (median 1.8%, 95% CI 0.9%–2.7%) and the highest error rates were observed for walking (median 5.5%, 95% CI 3.9%–7.1%). Second, none of the tested devices could produce energy expenditure data with less than 20% error. Third, the Apple Watch had the best overall error profile, while the Samsung Gear S2 had the worst.  The Apple Watch had the lowest error in heart rate, 2.0% (95% CI 1.2%–2.8%), while the Samsung Gear S2 had the highest heart rate error, 6.8% (95% CI 4.6%–9.0%)…"

4,Downtowner stifles mobility innovation in Aspen,"On Monday, the Aspen City Council approved spending $275,782 of the community's money to extend the Downtowner service until April, despite a 45 percent cost increase to cover the operator's rising expenses to run the same level of service.

The choice to extend the contract was claimed to be driven by an interest to be ""socially equitable."" Whether the Downtowner cost effectively creates social equity for users is debatable, but what's certain is that it's absolutely the least business-equitable program in our community.

Its economic impact on small-business mobility providers — shrinking their business — has been well documented and largely ignored. More importantly, what's unfortunate and inequitable about writing an enormous check to one business, which happens to be from out of town, is that it stifles innovation in the sector that it's meant to be the darling of: on-demand service mobility. What entrepreneur is going to invest to participate in providing shared mobility services when they have to compete with a service that the city has 100 percent backstopped?

In the interest of constructively providing alternatives, here are some ideas for how the $275,782 could be better spent to achieve the same goals.

1. $100,000 to provide pedicab chariots that locals can check out to provide no fare rides (gratuity optional). Pedicabs have a much lower fixed cost than the Downtowner electric carts and are more in line with our community values and cycling community claim.

2. $50,000 to make We-Cycle no-fare for all users and to provide for any additional stations required to service the same area as the Downtowner.

3. $25,000 to cover discounting rates of Car to Go rentals. Similar to Lyft and Uber rental car programs, the city pays a portion or all of the Car To Go rental based on the number of rides the renter services during the rental period.

4. $25,000 budgeted for rebates for locals who replace a gas vehicle with the purchase of an electric vehicle. This is in addition to the state and federal rebates.

5. $25,000 for rebates for locals purchasing an e-bike or bike to replace a gas vehicle (car registration discontinued).

4,The Wearable Devices Supporting Parkinson's,"Parkinson’s can be a debilitating condition, but there are a number of fascinating mobile and wearable devices aiming to improve matters for patients.

For instance, a mobile app called CloudUPDRS has been developed to allow mobile phone users to use the sensors in their phone to test for Parkinson’s.

The app hopes to mimic the tasks undertaken by the clinician.  The first version therefore took roughly the same length of time as a normal consultation.

“The reason it takes so long is because it’s hard to make sure that you get enough good data to make the tests reliable. So you have to overcompensate by performing each test for longer than necessary,” the team say.

A project from Imperial College London is attempting to help those already diagnosed with the condition via a glove that takes lessons from gyroscopes.  The device, which the team have called GyroGlove, attempts to reduce the hand tremors that make life so challenging for those with the disease.

AWS Device Farm testing doesn't give full performance picture","Mobile app users want a consistent experience for all apps -- on all devices. AWS Device Farm tests application features but doesn't give dev teams a full picture of performance.

Mobile applications need to perform the same across a range of device platforms. Testing and debugging those apps is time-consuming and expensive. AWS Device Farm enables developers to assess mobile app performance in real time -- before pushing it out to the consumer.

With AWS Device Farm, developers can access and interact with web-, iOS- and Android-based apps running on physical devices hosted in AWS. They can run automated Device Farm testing frameworks to debug and optimize new applications across a range of remote devices. They can also remotely access particular devices to load, run and use apps to understand how they will work in real time.

But because new devices and versions come to market all the time, developers must first determine that AWS Device Farm supports their device. New or lesser-known devices might have limited availability. AWS typically pools devices into common operating systems -- Android or iOS, for example. But users can create custom device pools, such as a group of the most popular or common devices that will use the app."

Built on Rainforest QA’s crowdsourcing and AI platform, the solution is faster, less expensive and delivers more reproducible results than any other mobile testing solution, all without requiring engineering resources to set up or manage.

 

Given the complexity of building on mobile — innumerable combinations of devices, operating systems, screen sizes, network operators and user scenarios — mobile application testing is one of the most time-consuming and expensive activities for QA and development teams. The challenge is exacerbated by the fact that test automation cannot adequately be applied to mobile app testing. According to a recent Capgemini report on quality and mobile testing, 65 percent of companies say a lack of tools is a key challenge of mobile testing, while nearly one in five companies blame a lack of time to test mobile apps. Since making the Rainforest Mobile Beta available in February to select customers, over 20,000 regression and exploratory tests have been executed by more than 3,000 testers."

Verizon Wireless once again earned PCMag’s number one ranking for 2017, but just by a nose. Overall, the nation’s leading mobile network services provider operated the most reliable and consistent high-speed mobile network in the land in what amounted to the closest competition PCMag has run in the eight years it has been conducting its nationwide speed and overall performance tests and ratings.

Fastest U.S. Mobile Network

While it retains its overall title for another year, Verizon Wireless split individual wins in 36 cities and rural regions three ways with AT&T and T-Mobile, PCMag’s Sascha Segan highlights.

Furthermore, AT&T earned the number one spot when it came to average mobile network download speed. In addition, T-Mobile bested Verizon Wireless on price in some service territories, while delivering about the same level of performance, according to the report.

Making for an “apples to apples” comparison, PCMag’s mobile network testing team spent most of May driving within and between 30 cities. The same Samsung Galaxy S8 smartphones and a custom version of Ookla’s Speedtest.net software were used to connect to, assess and compare mobile network connectivity and performance.

When all was said and done, the PCMag test team had collected more than 124,000 data points. Downloads, uploads, latency and reliability data were balanced to produce a PCMag Speed Score for AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless networks.

A prototype of Axiz has been built using commodity hardware components, using 3D vision=based self-calibration, and a four-axis Arduino-based robotic arm.  An external CMOS 1,080-pixel camera monitors the test execution.

Robotic testing can address the profound shift from desktop to mobile computation and make it possible to test more easily test features like UI gestures and sensor input.

Frameworks such as Appium, Robotium, and UIAutomator can partly support automatic test execution. However, they rely on human test script design, thereby creating a bottleneck.

Handheld devices require rethinking what black-box testing really means, including factors such as increased realism, device independence, cost-benefit ratio, and reduced reliance on assumptions.

It turns out, Axiz accurately executed each test event specified in the generated robotic-test cases and passed the required oracle checkpoints.

 This article first appeared in IEEE Software magazine. IEEE Software offers solid, peer-reviewed information about today's strategic technology issues. To meet the challenges of running reliable, flexible enterprises, IT managers and technical leads rely on IT Pro for state-of-the-art solutions.

Robots are widely used for many repetitive tasks. Why not software testing? Robotic testing could give testers a new form of testing that’s inherently more black-box than anything witnessed previously. Toward that end, we developed Axiz, a robotic-test generator for mobile apps. Here, we compare our approach with simulation-based test automation, describe scenarios in which robotic testing is bene cial (or even essential), and tell how we applied Axiz to the popular Google Calculator app.

Mobility User Experience (Ux)

Tipping Point: UX Can Make Your Business Disruption-Proof"
4,"UX is the ultimate goal and AI will help, but brands still struggle with data and channels","As customer experience becomes more of the basis for competitive advantage, more brands are focusing on consistent, personalized experiences, but they struggle with obtaining a single view of each customer and how to deal with data from different sources. That’s according to the fourth annual State of Marketing report from CRM firm Salesforce.

The study found this is further complicated by the never-ending stream of emerging channels – which must not only be addressed, but coordinated, too – and brands struggle to evolve messages across these channels. In addition, new roles are emerging as marketers work more closely with other departments. And, not surprisingly, top teams are more likely to tap into marketing technology. While marketers expect AI will substantially impact efficiency and personalization, challenges remain like defining an AI business strategy, as well as grappling with privacy and wrangling data stored in separate systems.

Salesforce surveyed 3500 marketing professionals around the world in April 2017. Here’s a closer look at the key findings:

New battleground

Salesforce said its 2016 State of Marketing report established customer experience as a significant focus, but now marketers are battling over it, too.

In fact, 68% of marketing leaders said their companies are increasingly competing on the basis of customer experience.

Over the past 18 months, 64% of marketers surveyed say their companies have become more focused on providing a consistent experience across every channel as a result of changing customer expectations.

“This is in part because customers increasingly expect consistent, personalized experiences — and their loyalty is on the line,” the report said.

This applies to businesses as well. While 52% of consumers are likely to switch brands if a company doesn’t make an effort to personalize communications, 65% of business buyers say the same about vendor relationships.

Salesforce also found consumers are more willing to trade data for better experiences. Among millennial consumers, 58% will share personal data in exchange for product recommendations that meet their needs, along with 52% of Gen X consumers.

A consistent brand experience

Obtaining a single view of the customer and leveraging data from different sources remain two of the biggest challenges in maintaining a consistent brand experience, the report found.

This is further complicated by the addition of new marketing and communication channels."
4,Hulu’s New UX Is Beautiful–And Frustrating,"Inspired by the light and space artist James Turrell, Hulu reinvents its user experience for the post-cable world. But it still has a ways to go.

By Diana Budds

Cable killed the television antenna and now it too is facing obsolescence.  Streaming services are slowly chipping away at cable’s customer base, as they upend how we watch our favorite shows and attempt to reprogram how we watch television.

Last month the streaming service Hulu launched a beta version of Hulu Live, an ambitious cable alternative that lets viewers tune into live shows from networks like CBS, FOX, ESPN, Bravo, CNN, and more for $40 a month–a fraction of the cost of a typical subscription. Viewers can access content on their mobile devices and on their televisions, and Hulu Live gives subscribers the option to record shows for later viewing. The idea is to bring users the convenience of anytime, anywhere streaming with the instant gratification of live television.

When Hulu launched about 10 years ago, it was in uncharted territory, but now it faces significant competition. Companies like Amazon, Netflix, and Youtube are all vying for our attention and, aside from original content, are all more or less offering a very similar assortment of shows. What might make one service more appealing than another boils down to user experience.

“Given that we have so much competition, we thought, ‘How can we differentiate [ourselves]?'” John S. Couch, vice president of UX and design at Hulu, says. “And obviously experience was a great way to do that.”

The project to revamp its television watching experience began in January 2016. At the time, Hulu only had six designers on staff. The company beefed up its design team–it has over 40 people now–and consulted with the experience design agency Huge. The result is a totally new way to access Hulu’s shows. But does it work?

An Antidote To Information Overload

One of the biggest headaches with watching shows–whether on cable or through a streaming service–is finding what you want. There are thousands of options out there. The balancing act becomes about giving people what they want while also serving up new things. It’s essentially an organizational challenge whose solutions are stuck in the antenna era, Couch argues."

4,"Finding the balance of security, mobility in an Internet of Things world","The use of mobile technologies and the evolution to the Internet of Things (IoT) is reshaping the way government executes on its mission. From smartphones and tablets that let employees work from anywhere at any time to the wide adoption of WiFi at places like the Pentagon.

At the same time, the move to mobile presents a major challengecybersecurity. How can agencies secure the ever-growing number of devices?

Among the most startling findings of a Homeland Security Department report from March was that mobile devices could become an avenue to attack back-end computer systems containing the data of millions of Americans and sensitive information related to federal government functions.

DHS made 10 recommendations ranging from agencies adopting a framework for mobile device security based on existing standards and best practices to Congress and OMB enhancing the metrics for the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) to focus on securing mobile devices, applications and network infrastructure.

The security of mobile devices becomes even more important when you consider this evolution offers agencies a path to improve productivity and communications and the overall services to citizens.

Paul Battaglia, the vice president of federal sales for Blackberry, said agencies are struggling to secure the growing number of mobile devices. He said federal chief information officers and chief information security officers are looking for a way to monitor, in real time, the cyber health of all of these assorted devices through a single central dashboard.

Management of all these devices has become overwhelming. So what we need to do is get to a more centralized management so we can do away with these multiple systems trying to manage things, Battaglia said on the Innovation in Government show. That is the foremost goal, find a unified system on a single pane of glass that can get us good management."
4,Mobile computing is one of the biggest IT workplace security challenges - make sure your business is safe and secure,"Leading software vendor VXL Software's device management suite, Fusion EMM, not only manages and secures your desktop and laptop PCs but crucially, also covers all your mobile devices including in the event that they are stolen or accidently lost.

While the rapid expansion of mobile device usage in the workplace undoubtedly enhances employee productivity, it also has thrown up inevitable security and privacy issues. These devices are no longer fixed to desks and are with people all the time both at home and work. As Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) strategies featuring smartphones and tablets become more widely adopted, the growing concerns for security and data privacy have become even more paramount.

""Mobile devices in the work place are proliferating at an exponential rate, introducing a new set of security and management challenges for organisations"", said Frank Noon VP Worldwide Sales. ""Employees can now simply access everything from email to presentations on a device that they hold in their hand. Added to the fact that smartphones and tablets also come from many vendors and have different operating systems means further potential issues in terms of management and security"" he added.

The answer is a Unified End-point Management solution that provides a dedicated tool to manage and secure everything. For both SMB's and large enterprises, there's simply too much at stake to leave these devices unmanaged. The solution is UEM (Unified Endpoint Management) and in particular Fusion EMM (Enterprise Mobility Management) from VXL Software.

A stolen or lost mobile device presents an immediate high security risk. Fusion EMM can remotely and quickly delete sensitive data from any device running iOS (IPhones / IPads) and Android OS devices (Lollipop and above) as well as all Windows OS desktop variants.

For mobile devices, device management has already moved from being merely useful to being absolutely essential. In the future, not managing devices in some way or another will be unthinkable and potentially catastrophic for all types of businesses.

However, as organisations require mobile devices to do more, concerns understandably grow as corporate data has to be both effectively managed as well as protected."
4,Enterprise software mobility a prerequisite to digital transformation,"IFS study demonstrates better mobile access to enterprise software is a factor in readiness for digital transformation among industrial companies

IFS (http://www4.ifsworld.com/l/5332/2015-08-10/2qts7r), the global enterprise applications company, has released a primary research study that shows a strong relationship between mobile access to industrial companies' enterprise software and their readiness for digital transformation. The study surveyed 200 industrial users of enterprise resource planning, field service management, enterprise asset management and other types of enterprise software.

Key findings of the study include:

• Respondents who said their enterprise software prepared them well for digital transformation were more than twice as likely to access their software from a mobile device than those who said their software did a poor job of preparing them for digital transformation. There is a relationship between enterprise mobility and readiness for digital transformation.

• For almost 70 percent of respondents, increasing mobile access to enterprise software may be an immediate digital transformation opportunity. Only 31 percent of respondents said they access enterprise software through a mobile device.

• While tablet computers were the device most frequently used to access various types of enterprise software, only 17 percent of respondents said their entire enterprise suite was accessible by tablets and other touchscreen devices.

• Poor mobile access and the resulting lack of readiness for digital transformation can prevent companies from establishing service-focused business models. Respondents, mostly in complex and industrial manufacturing, were as much as 22 percent more likely to engage in business models like aftermarket service, field service management or depot repair if they said their enterprise software did a good job of preparing them for digital transformation."

Timecraft is a cool Minecraft-inspired Android Wear watch face by Tha PHLASH","What's time but a series of building blocks of infinitesimally small moments? You change one block and the whole structure could be modified, you add and add and add more blocks, hoping the final result is beautiful and meaningful, and you look around at others' structures learning from them and sometimes envying or criticizing them. That's one philosophical way of introducing this new watch face by Tha PHLASH, Timecraft.

Like its name and all of the screenshots here suggest, Timecraft is inspired by Minecraft. The signature blocky design is there, the green and grey/brown colors are present as well, and although I've never actively played the game or got lost in its world, I can easily spot the similarities based on what little I've seen from it.

As a watch face, Timecraft works on round and square watches of all screen resolutions.

Researchers at Birmingham City University’s Digital Media Technology Lab (DMT Lab) are devising the system which enables users to interact with virtual models and patient data using freehand movements.

The system allows users to manipulate, navigate and demonstrate patient data using hand motions and gestures, so that practitioners can showcase medical procedures, lifestyle choices, and treatment effects using customised 3D virtual models and patients’ real medical records.

It could be used to visually demonstrate medical problems, the areas where surgery will be conducted, improvements which could be made following treatment or the damage caused by harmful addictive substances such as tobacco.

The technology uses motion detecting sensors combined with the DMT Lab expertise in freehand interaction in Mixed Reality to create a more realistic experience in virtual environments and bridge the gap between users and technology.

4,Researchers developing wearable tech for stroke patients,"According to the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, more than 400,000 Canadians are living with a long-term disability as a result of having a stroke. Many of these individuals have impaired arm or hand mobility, making it challenging to perform basic everyday tasks.

SFU professor Carlo Menon, who specializes in assistive and rehabilitation technologies, is developing wearable technologies that could significantly improve stroke patients' recovery.

“Many conditions, including stroke, can cause an individual to lose their normal hand movement,” says Menon, a professor in the School of Mechatronic Systems Engineering and the School of Engineering Science.

“We are creating wearable technologies to assist in the recovery process and improve motor function in the hand.”

Menon is a newly appointed Tier 1 Canada Research Chair (CRC) in Biomedical Technology, and one of four new SFU CRCs announced this spring. He also received a Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR) Foundation Grant last year to fund his research.

The technologies focus on assisting individuals to move their fingers. Currently, Menon and his team are working on refining their prototype and ensuring that it accomplishes three main functions: monitoring finger movements, monitoring the force exerted by the hand and controlling external devices.

That latter function will also play a key role in assisting individuals who have a permanent injury and are unable to recover their finger movements. In this case, the technology will help the person communicate with a computer, wheelchair or other instrument needed to complete daily tasks.

“What we’re building will be portable, wearable and compact to ensure that it is comfortable to wear for a long period of time without interfering with the individual’s activities,” says Menon… (http://www.sfu.ca/)"

Changes include putting the URL at the top of search cards, fewer ads, and adding more color to organic search cards.

Here is a look at the new design, which was caught accidentally when conducting a search for “AdWords audit.”

As you can see, there are only two ads at the top of the page compared to the usual four ads. Titles and URLs within organic and paid search cards have been rearranged.

Interestingly enough, the colored dots in the top right-hand corner of organic search cards are purely an aesthetic change. They serve no actual function.

Tapping on the colored dots does nothing. My best guess is they are there to indicate the displayed URL has been shortened.

Here’s a look at the new design toward the bottom of the SERP.

Looking at this screenshot, you can see there is only one ad included at the bottom of the page compared to the usual three ads.
